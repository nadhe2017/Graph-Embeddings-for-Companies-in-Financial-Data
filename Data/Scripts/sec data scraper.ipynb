A copy of the Share Exchange Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2.1, and a copy of a list of our Subsidiaries is filed as Exhibit 21.1, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  OUR BUSINESS  Overview   Our operating subsidiary, Chenyuhui, currently focuses on being a leading grower of organic agricultural products and green food products in central China region. We are vertically integrated and control the entire production chain of our productsfrom processing to marketing. We strive to respond rapidly to changing market conditions while carefully controlling the quality and consistency of our products. Given the popularity of online shopping in China, we primarily sell our products online. To further facilitate the exchange of our products and broaden our customer base, we plan to establish a chain of retail stores called Mrs. Xin in which our own organic agricultural products and green food products are sold to retailers and wholesalers alike. Chenyuhui also strives to develop rural recreational tourism, agritourism, and non-urban recreational activities. We aim at cultivating a unique brand in the eco-agriculture and rural tourism market in China. As first step to venture into rural tourism business, we opened our country themed restaurant  SunnyTaste Diner in 2013.  In the near future, we intend to expand beyond our catering business to deepen our presence in the recreational tourism industry by creating a unique SunnyTaste Ecological Agriculture Park. We have already crafted a plan to develop this truly one of a kind rural based amusement park with multiple facilities, including farming culture museum, local tribal culture museum, rural economic and cultural exchange center, traditional Chinese education training camp, rural vocational and technical training center.  As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, ADVV, through its operating subsidiary, has 173 employees and is located in Room 1424 Block 3, Zhong Jian Jin Xiang Plaza, Hubei, China, China.  Our major services      6     Table of Contents  Online Selling Model To broaden our consumer base, we have tapped into the e-commerce market in China by registering with some of Chinese biggest e-commerce platforms such as JD.com, Tmall, and suning.com. With the assistance of a dedicated 9-person online marketing operation team, we regularly update and add new products to our online marketplace catalog.   We also utilize WeChat, the largest multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app in China to actively promote our brands and reach out to our customers throughout the entire China. Because WeChat enables us to create our Mrs. Xin Official Accounts and establish a virtual marketplace, we can easily attract a large number of customers from anywhere and respond to their requests at a much faster rate than selling our products in a physical store.   SunnyTaste Countryside Diner  At present, the company's major catering business is SunnyTaste Countryside Diner, a country themed restaurant located in Hubei China. The diner currently has 15 large, medium and small private dining rooms, and a 400-people dining hall, which in total can accommodate around 500 people at any given time. The Diner offers a variety of popular authentic home-cooked Chinese meals, catering for various dietary requirements including coeliacs and vegetarians. Since its inception, we have successfully utilize SunnyTaste Countryside Diner as a platform to promote our own food brand Mrs. Xin. Our standard menu features our most popular main dishes prepared in the authentic Central China country style as well as a wide selection of other dishes, appetizers, desserts and beverages. We periodically offer new dishes and seasonal menu selections to attract more customer visits. Given the increasing popularity of rural tourism, we estimate that SunnyTaste Countryside Diner can achieve approximately 1.5 million customer visits at the end of 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, average traffic per restaurant per day was approximately 3,000 customers.   We believe that the following four factors contribute to the quality of the food we offer: quality ingredients supplied exclusively by our own production line, country themed meal selection, on-site food preparation and effective quality monitoring. We only use ingredients supplied by our own production line so that we can continuously monitor the quality of our food. For each dish, we develop and prepare unique sauce package based on the recipe we have developed to cater to popular customer tastes in China. Each dish is then freshly prepared in batches on stovetops in restaurant kitchen by our well-trained cooks. To ensure that food quality is consistently maintained in our restaurants, we have a food safety and quality assurance program in place to maintain high standards for our food supply and preparation procedures.  The SunnyTaste Countryside Diner is the first step of the company's comprehensive plan to build an ecological agricultural park in Hubei, China.   Our Products and Market  At present, we offer three major categories of green food products: fruits, vegetables and grain crops.  Fruits: we grow nearly 20 kinds of fruit products, including grape, strawberry, sand pear, kiwi, peach, mulberry, alfalfa, citrus, bayberry, etc. Our principal fruit products are Asian pears and citrus which are most suitable for planting in the central region.  Vegetables: we grow nearly 40 kinds of vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, small pumpkins, eggplant, cabbage, spinach, leeks, peppers, bitter gourd, loofah, etc.  Grain Crops: we grow grain crops are mainly rice, and a rice planting demonstration base with a total area of nearly 5,000 mu in Mahe and Guishan has been established. Organic and green japonica rice are planted, and the farms of Shanghai Guangming Group are co-operated. Production of organic and green japonica rice, planting scale of 50,000 acres.  Besides producing our own organic and green food products, we also provide a robust offering from local food product suppliers within the municipality of Hubei, China. Through distribution rights and agreements, we serve as the product suppliers representative utilizing both traditional wholesale platforms and high technology platforms such as the WeChat mobile application to offer products to end purchasers such as individual consumers, restaurants and food suppliers, merchants, stores and supermarkets.  Our Company also offered processed food products, which are produced in two ways: self-production and outsourcing. Our own production line focuses on pickles products, bean products, pickled meat and poultry products. Due to increasing demand, we also outsource a portion of our production to third party food processors. We supply them with raw materials and the company's quality control department constantly monitor third partys production progress through routine inspection and written reports. All the processed food products, regardless of its production origins, are subject to the same rigorous standards set forth by us.      7     Table of Contents  Running Piglets  The Running Piglet, our principal meat product, is a unique pork brand we cultivated. The pork products have been our principal products since they were first introduced in the market in 2016. The breeding base of the pigs is located in Mahe, Jingmen, China. The facility for pork products manufacturing, sales and marketing, as well as brand management is located in Zhanghe District, Jingmen, China. The pigs are bred by mixing two types of pigs: Huai pigs and Luchuan pigs. They are bred in the wild, and it typically takes 10 to 12 months before pigs mature. The pigs are fed with forage made of corn flour, rice bran, bran, clam shell, and natural probiotics. We create individual profiles for all the pigs, with their daily routines recorded, so that we can obtain all the relevant information during the growth of the pigs. On a daily basis, the pigs drink natural spring water, breathe fresh air, and climb down the mountains upon call of music. They keep a regular daily routine, and in particular, they exercise by climbing the mountains or swimming for about eight hours every day, which we believe substantially enhance the quality of the pork meat.   Our pork products quickly became popular among customers who praised their high quality, savory taste, and pleasant texture. In 2018, we plan to put additional sales and marketing efforts in cities such as Xian and Wuhan, and to expand into the markets of Northwestern China, Central China, Southern China and Southwestern China, with the goal of making Running Piglets a national brand for pork products.   Competitive Advantages  We believe that our competitive advantages include offering a highly diversified product portfolio, which allows us to appeal to a broader market than our major competitors. We also believe that the proximity between our own regional food production centers and retail stores selling our products enables us to avoid the need to transport fresh food products over long distances to processing facilities, thereby reducing our transportation expenses and damage to fresh food products during transportation; it also helps us maintaining high quality of finished products by preserving freshness. In addition, using innovative on-line off-line (O2O) marketing and distribution platform such as the WeChat mobile application allows the consumers to order their foods directly to their door providing us a much greater market penetration.  Research and Development  At present, the Company only has technical maintenance personnel, which are mainly concentrated in our production department. They are responsible for technical maintenance work related to fruit and vegetable cultivation. We currently does not have a research and development team.  Industry and Principal Markets  China Food Processing Market  Chinas food processing industry sales values continued to grow steadily. According to the Global Agricultural Information Networks annual report, the food processing market estimates its 2017 revenues amounted to RMB 18 trillion (nearly US$2.5 trillion). The continuous urbanization has resulted in increased job opportunities for a population of 13.22 million in urban areas in 2017, creating an even larger demand for packaged food. The per capita disposal income at the national level grew by 6.7 percent in 2017, according to Premiers government work report in March 2017. Given the huge demand for enough food to feed a population of 1.4 billion, coupled with increasing demand for quicker, safer and healthier food, Chinas food industry is likely to see continued growth at a fast pace in the future.   Many food manufacturers have launched new strategies, including employing high quality ingredients, introducing new technologies, and diversifying product lines. It is expected that this trend of introducing newer technologies, better food ingredients and more creative food innovations will improve the long-term prospects for Chinas food industry. Particularly, with the industrys increased scale, innovation and profitability, it is likely to also boost the use of imported food ingredients.  China Foodservice Restaurant Market  China Foodservice Restaurant Market is a rapidly growing market with a lot of potentials. According to Research & Market report, Chinas food service restaurants are various types of chain and independent foodservice providers. The China food service restaurant market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% during the forecast period of 2018-2023. China is the largest market for foodservice restaurants, globally, ahead of the US, which is the second largest market.      8     Table of Contents  The primary factors driving the market for food service restaurants are the increased dining out for socialising, business meetings, family gatherings, gathering with friends and the unwillingness of consumers to cook at home. The revenue of China's foodservice industry is expected to exceed 3.9 trillion yuan (about $603.6 billion) for 2018, up 10.7 percent compared to 2076, according to the latest statistics from the Chinese Cuisine Association. The association's 2017 annual food consumption report shows that in 2017, Chinese-style meals still dominate, accounting for 57 percent of the total. The report also shows that younger customers are the driving force among food and beverage consumers, accounting for around half of all food and beverage consumption. The value of China's takeaway food app market is expected to exceed 200 billion yuan in 2017, according to the report. This is a substantial increase on the 166 billion yuan recorded in 2016. An earlier report released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that from January to October 2017, the income from national food and beverage sales was 3.2 trillion yuan, up 11 percent from the same period in 2016.  Our Customers  The PRC has over 20% of the worlds population, but only has 6% of arable land. This puts an incredible burden on the country and the government to fulfill the growing demands of China. In addition, we believe that the concept of living healthy by eating healthy is now widely accepted in China, a trend that truly motivates people to purchase organic food products. Management believes that this trend will continue to provide an excellent opportunity for the Company to grow.   Although we mainly serve the customers in Hubei, we are able to reach customers who have access to the Internet and a mobile device. Customers from anywhere can order our food products directly online. We retained several reputable delivery services companies in China, such as SF Express, to help us deliver our products on a national scale.   Our SunnyTaste Diner primarily serve local customers in Hubei. After the completion of our comprehensive plan to build the ecological agricultural park, we expect SunnyTaste Diner could attracter customers from places all over China.   Competition   Even though we compete locally, the two major markets in which we operate, food processing market and foodservice restaurant market, are both competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting customer demands and expectations. There are a number of companies that compete directly with our services and some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources than we possess. In the food process market, our major competitors are Hubei Fanhua Agricultural Technology Development Co., Ltd. and Wuhan Tianjian Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., both of which have been in the food processing market longer than us and have significant more financial resources. However, we believe we compete with them favorably because of the quality and diversity of our food products. In the rural tourism market, we primarily compete with Wuhan Qiansen Island Manor Development Co. Ltd., which has a significantly longer operating history than we do.   We believe our competitive advantages include our online marketing model, which will help us reach more customers than our competitors conventional methods, as there are few other companies currently providing this sales and distribution method.   In terms of our rural tourism business, we intend to become truly one of the kind in Hubei China and we are not aware of any other company in Hubei that currently provides the same services as we intend to. Our rural tourism projects, coupled with our existing agricultural products, will eventually form a large-scale rural tourism ecosystem, which will eventually cultivate a unique and strong brand surpassing brands of our competitors.  Our Strategy  Our goal is to become a leading provider of organic and green food and rural tourism in China. We intend to achieve this goal by implementing the following strategies:  Maximize our existing resources to increase our profitability         Expanding our sales force both within the municipality and nationally through direct recruitment of sales and IT development staff       In addition to our O2O sales and distribution platform we also have our own website. (www.sunnytaste.com)       Strengthening relationship with our existing clients by offering sales promotion incentives such as discounts, and vacation travel packages through our affiliate resort and hotel partners.       Continually expanding our product offerings.       Developing further partnerships with farm machinery and equipment manufacturers.       Developing a further client base of food distributors and importers throughout China.      9     Table of Contents  Focus on improved efficiencies  We will continue to focus on efforts on improving the overall efficiency of O2O performance through exploring various options on new technologies and alternative platforms to benefit both our clients and our customers. We will address issues that arise from our food processing and rural tourism business, primarily; product safety, environmental protection, occupational health, compliance with requirements of import and export rules and regulations.  Continue to Provide Quality Food and Develop New Menu Items to Attract More Customer Visits   We plan to keep a simple but diversified menu to retain our existing customers and to develop new menu items to attract more customer visits. Our menu selections are regularly reviewed and updated with new dishes or seasonal menu selections by our staff to reflect changes in seasons, changing market health and food trends and minor differences in tastes and preferences among customers who enjoy green and healthy meals in the countryside. From time to time, we test new menu items in our restaurant; We will continue to develop new menu items to attract more customer visits, and we will continue to experiment with new seasonings and flavors in order to create new and improved menu items.  Further Enhance Our Brand Recognition  We believe that enhancing customer recognition of the Mrs. Xin brand is crucial to our success. We have been developing our brand since 2015. We believe that a vital part of brand-building is enthusiastic word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied customers. It has always been the focal point of our business to continue to focus on offering healthy, green, delicious and affordable everyday Chinese food and a satisfying overall experience to each of our customers. In addition, we plan to continue to enhance customer awareness of our brand by conducting in-store promotional activities in our restaurant, offering coupons and discounts. We also intend to pursue focused marketing campaigns to reach out to areas with a high concentration of potential customers and to place advertisements in residential communities and office buildings.  Suppliers  Although most of our suppliers are company-owned or in-house, we do occasionally procure raw material from local suppliers that are located principally within the municipality of Hubei, China. Through distribution rights and agreements, we also occasionally work as our local suppliers representative utilizing high technology platforms such as the WeChat mobile application to offer products on their behalf to end purchasers such as restaurants and food suppliers, merchants, stores and supermarkets.  Marketing, Sales and Distribution  We market our products through three primary methods: direct contact with domestic businesses, attendance at exhibitions we sponsor, sales made through on-line and offline platforms such as WeChat, and expect to reach customers through our website. Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to maintain a consistent message to our customers of delivering high quality and farm fresh products.  PRC Government Regulations  Our products are subject to central government regulation as well as provincial government regulation in Hubei Province. Business and product licenses must be obtained through application to the central, provincial and local governments. We have obtained our business licenses to operate domestically under the laws and regulations of the PRC. We obtained business licenses to conduct businesses, including an operating license to sell packaged foods, meat and dried meat, fruits and vegetables, fruit sugar, fruit pectin, dried fruits and vegetables, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, fruit and vegetable juice drinks, and organic food.   In accordance with PRC laws and regulations, all our suppliers are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.  In the PRC, we will have to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the distribution of Internet content in China such as the Application of the Appropriate Internet Content Provider License and our data usage policy has to be in accordance with Regulations of The Peoples Republic of China for Safety Protection of Computer Information System.      10     Table of Contents  Food Safety Laws  Our products meet the requirements of general Food Safety Law of the People Republic of China, Quality and Safety of Agricultural Products Law of the People's Republic of China and the Product Quality Law of the People's Republic of China. In order to enter the processing food market in China, the State implements a market access system for food quality and safety, and a licensing system for food production and operation. Those who engage in food production and food sales are generally required to obtain permits covering the specific type of food they are allowed to produce. However, there is no need to obtain permit to sell edible agricultural products. Therefore, we only need to apply for the \"Food Production License\" and \"Enterprise Business License\". The \"Enterprise Business License\" stipulates our business scope, which covers cured meat products, fish products, starch products, soybean products (non-fermented soybean products) and other soybean products, wine, fruit wine, rice, enzymes, honey production, crops, rice products, and etc. We also obtained business license allowing us to conduct nursery stock cultivation, vegetables, fruits cultivation, processing, online and physical sales of cured meat products, fish products, starch products, soybean products (non-fermented soybean products) and other soybean products, pre-packaged food, bulk food, dairy products (excluding infant formula milk powder) crops (excluding grain purchase and other specially regulated food products) Vegetables, fruits, wines, wine, rice, enzymes, honey, large restaurants (including cold dishes), cultivation, breeding technology research and development, technical services, bio-fertilizer research and marketing, conference services, aquatic products, livestock and poultry breeding. Our sales must be conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, we must abide by the provisions of the Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China. In the process of food production, we must abide by relevant food safety standards, food production and operation standards and hygiene standards.  Employment Laws  We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, and social insurance, housing funds and other welfare that may be applicable. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance.   China's National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and China's National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, permits workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract. The National Labor Contract Law has enhanced rights for the nation's workers, including permitting open-ended labor contracts and severance payments. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary labor and makes it harder for employers to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with fixed-term contracts be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after a fixed-term contract is renewed twice or the employee has worked for the employer for a consecutive ten-year period.   Foreign Currency Exchange  The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations promulgated by the State Council, as amended on August 5, 2008, or the Foreign Exchange Regulations. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless prior approval of the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents and, in the case of capital account item transactions, obtaining approval from the SAFE. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside of China are also subject to limitations, which include approvals by the Ministry of Commerce (\"MOFCOM\"), the SAFE and the State Reform and Development Commission.  Dividend Distributions  Under applicable PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a foreign-invested enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.      11     Table of Contents  Properties  Our principal executive offices are located at: Room 1424 Block 3, Zhong Jian Jin Xiang Plaza, Hubei, China.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  The following financial data was extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements of Sunny Taste Group Limited. The financial year ends at December 31 for Sunny Taste Group Limited and its subsidiaries.  Our revenues were $333,031 and $3,298 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. Our net loss was $6,373,394 and $1,336,435 for the respective periods.  Principal Factors Affecting Financial Performance  We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the food and recreational industries, including trends affecting the food processing and tourism industries, trends affecting the customer bases that we target, and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include:        Solid Governmental support The food industry plays an important part in the economic development of China, which is also recognized by the Chinese government. Each year, the government supports companies in this industry by imposing favorable policies and providing subsidies. We believe, under these desirable conditions, our company will grow exponentially in the future.             Health Awareness in China We mainly conduct our business in China. In recent years, accompanied by economic growth, the Chinese people have developed an increased health awareness, which drives them to purchase high quality organic products. We match this idea by producing organic food and delivering it from our farm to our retail stores without travelling a long distance. This trend could have a material impact on our customer base.  Results of Operations  As of December 31, 2017, the accumulated deficit was $(9,139,338) and $(2,765,994) respectively. Our ability to operate as a going concern depends largely on if we are able to generate sufficient profits to make payments when due and meet obligations. We intend to increase revenue through the projects and activities stated above in OUR BUSINESS paragraphs but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing our plans.   The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto.       12     Table of Contents  Results of operations of Sunny Taste Group Limited  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016  The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.          Year ended December 31, 2017      Year ended December 31, 2016      Change     Net revenues   $ 333,031     $ 3,298     $ 329,733     Cost of revenues     1,057,172       5,961       1,051,211     Gross profit     (724,141 )     (2,663 )     (721,478 )   Operating expenses:                           Selling and marketing expenses     244,900       48,790       196,110     General and administrative expenses     5,266,554       1,185,335       4,081,219     Total operating expenses     5,511,454       1,234,125       4,277,329     Total other income/(expenses)     (137,799 )     (99,647 )     (38,152 )   Loss before tax     (6,373,394 )     (1,336,435 )     (5,036,959 )   Tax expense     -       -       -     Net loss   $ (6,373,394 )   $ (1,336,435 )   $ (5,036,959 )  Revenues. We generated $333,031 and $3,298 in revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The revenues in 2017 were generated primarily by selling fruits and rice as well as operating a restaurant inside our premises. Our revenues increased $329,733 in the year 2017 compared to the year 2016. Such increase was mainly due to selling more types of products. For example, fruits and rice were newly available in 2017, which constituted nearly half of the revenues.   Cost of revenues. We incurred $1,057,172 cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5,961 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The growth of cost of revenues was due to generating more revenues.  Gross profit. As a combined result of revenues and cost of revenues, the gross profits were $(724,141) and $(2,663) for the respective periods.   Selling and marketing expenses. Our selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salary expenses, advertising expenses and amortization. Our selling and marketing expenses increased to $244,900 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $48,790 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Such increase was due to hiring more sales people and incurring more advertising expenses to promote our products and projects.   General and administrative expenses. Our general and administrative expenses consisted mainly of research and development expenses, write-offs of receivables and prepayments, and professional fees. Our general and administrative expenses increased by $4,081,219 to $5,266,554 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Such increase incurred mainly because we expended more on the three expenditures stated above.   Net loss. As a cumulated effect of the factors described above, our net loss increased by $5,036,959 to $6,373,394 for the year ended December 31, 2017.      13     Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources      Working capital    December 31, 2017      December 31, 2016     Total current assets   $ 2,104,812     $ 6,048,911     Total current liabilities     14,809,454       9,850,927     Working capital surplus/(deficiency)   $ (12,704,642 )   $ (3,802,016 )  As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $155,244. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through contributions by owners and borrowings from related parties.   We believe that our current cash and financing from our existing stockholders are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, in the future, require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions, implementation of our strategy to expand our business or other investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our own financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.   The following table provides detailed information about our net cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 in this report:   Cash Flow           2017      2016     Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities   $ (4,009,788 )   $ (3,680,790 )   Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities     (2,900,855 )     (3,729,037 )   Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities     7,032,688       7,435,691     Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents     122,045       25,864     Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents     (1,865 )     (1,922 )   Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period     35,064       11,122     Cash and cash equivalents at end of period   $ 155,244     $ 35,064    Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $4,009,788 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to that of $3,680,790 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of in net cash used in operating activities was mainly because of a significant rise in net loss.  Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2,990,855, as compared to $3,729,037 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily because we spent less in purchasing intangible assets.       14     Table of Contents  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7,032,688, as compared to $7,435,691 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to the repayment of borrowings.   Capital Expenditures  Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $ 2,896,282 and $3,729,037 respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to the fact that we spent less in purchasing intangibles assets in the year 2017.   We anticipate a spend of approximately $1,650,000 and $6,550,000 on purchasing plant and equipment, and constructions in progress in the fiscal years of 2018 and 2019 respectively.   Inflation  Inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. However, our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost control in operations.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities.  Critical Accounting Policies  Method of accounting  Management has prepared the accompanying financial statements and these notes in accordance to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America; the Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method accounting.  Use of estimates  The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  Cash and cash equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less, and unencumbered bank deposits to be cash equivalents.  Accounts receivables  Trade receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off against allowances.  Inventories  Inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Finished goods costs include: materials, direct labor, inbound shipping costs, and allocated overhead. The Company applies the weighted average cost method to its inventory.  Advances and prepayments to suppliers  The Company makes advance payment to suppliers and vendors for the procurement of raw materials. Upon physical receipt and inspection of the raw materials from suppliers the applicable amount is reclassified from advances and prepayments to suppliers to inventory.       15     Table of Contents  Plant and equipment  Plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The Companys typically applies a salvage value of 0% to 10%. The estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:      Landscaping, plant and tree  1-3 years   Machinery and equipment  5-10 years  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss are included in the Companys results of operations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized to expenses as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.   Intangible assets  Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are as follows:      Land use rights   20-40 years   Software licenses   5-10 years   Trademarks   20-40 years  Construction in progress and prepayments for equipment  Construction in progress and prepayments for equipment represent direct and indirect acquisition and construction costs for plants, and costs of acquisition and installation of related equipment. Amounts classified as construction in progress and prepayments for equipment are transferred to plant and equipment when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use are completed. Depreciation is not provided for assets classified in this account.   Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets  The Company annually reviews its long-lived assets for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Impairment may be the result of becoming obsolete from a change in the industry, introduction of new technologies, or if the Company has inadequate working capital to utilize the long-lived assets to generate the adequate profits. Impairment is present if the carrying amount of an asset is less than its expected future undiscounted cash flows.  If an asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.  Statutory reserves  Statutory reserves are referring to the amount appropriated from the net income in accordance with laws or regulations, which can be used to recover losses and increase capital, as approved, and are to be used to expand production or operations. PRC laws prescribe that an enterprise operating at a profit must appropriate and reserve, on an annual basis, an amount equal to 10% of its profit. Such an appropriation is necessary until the reserve reaches a maximum that is equal to 50% of the enterprises PRC registered capital.        16     Table of Contents  Foreign currency translation  The accompanying financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The functional currencies of the Company are in Renminbi (RMB).

The Company's the amount of revenue recognized to the books reflects the value of goods invoiced, net of any value-added tax (VAT) or excise tax.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. The updated guidance eliminates Step 2 of the impairment test, which requires entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, determined in Step 1. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the financial statements of this guidance.  In January 2017, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for business combinations. The amendments clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on the financial statements of this guidance.  In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which addresses the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The guidance requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.  In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting for Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, not based on incurred losses. Further, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than twelve months. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated guidance primarily addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.

Director Compensation  We have not compensated our directors, in their capacities as such, since our inception.       21     Table of Contents  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS  SEC rules require us to disclose any transaction or currently proposed transaction in which the Company is a participant and in which any related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest involving the lesser of $120,000 or one percent (1%) of the average of the Companys total assets as of the end of last two completed fiscal years. A related person is any executive officer, director, nominee for director, or holder of 5% or more of the Companys Common Stock, or an immediate family member of any of those persons.  The descriptions set forth above under the captions The Share Exchange and Related TransactionsShare Exchange Agreement, Executive CompensationEmployment Agreements and Director Compensation and below under Description of SecuritiesOptions are incorporated herein by reference.  We currently do not have a policy in place for dealing with related party matters.  DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES  Common Stock  Our authorized capital stock consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share. As dictated by our Articles of Incorporation, all shares of common stock have equal rights and privileges with respect to (i) one non-cumulative vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders (ii) to participate equally and to receive any and all such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor and (iii) to participate pro rata in any distribution of assets available for distribution upon liquidation of the Company. Stockholders of the Company have no pre-emptive rights to acquire additional shares of common stock or any other securities. The common stock is not subject to redemption and carries no subscription or conversion rights. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The Articles of Incorporation may only be amended by a majority vote of the stockholders holding at least a majority of each class of stock outstanding and entitled to vote. A quorum of outstanding shares for voting on an Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation shall not be met unless 51% or more of the issued and outstanding shares are present at a properly called and noticed meeting of the Stockholders.  In the event of any merger or consolidation with or into another company in connection with which shares of our common stock are converted into or exchangeable for shares of stock, other securities or property (including cash) a general or special shareholder's meeting should be called for such purpose, wherein all shareholder's would be entitled to vote in person or by proxy. In the notice of such a shareholder's meeting and proxy statement, the Company will provide shareholders complete disclosure documentation concerning a potential acquisition of merger candidate, including financial information about the target and all material terms of the acquisition or merger transaction.  MARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS  Our common stock trades in the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol ADVV. The OTC Pink marketplace is a quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over-the-counter (OTC) equity securities. An OTC Pink equity security generally is any equity that is not listed or traded on a national securities exchange.      22     Table of Contents  Price Range of Common Stock  The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the high and low bid prices per share of our common stock as reported by the OTC Pink quotation service. These bid prices represent prices quoted by broker-dealers on the OTC Pink quotation service. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.         High      Low     Fiscal Year 2018    Bid      Bid     First Quarter   $ 5.5     $ 1.0     Second Quarter   $ 5.5     $ 2.0     Third Quarter   $ 2.5     $ 1.9       Fiscal Year 2017    Bid      Bid     Third Quarter   $ 1.0     $ 1.0     Fourth Quarter   $ 1.0     $ 1.0    There is no public market for shares of common stock of the Company. Although the Company's shares are quoted on the OTC Markets Pink, the Company is aware of only a few transactions that have taken place in the previous ten years. In any event, no assurance can be given that any market for the Company's common stock will develop or be maintained.  Stockholders of Record  As of December 26, 2018 there were approximately 23 stockholders of record of our common stock.  Preferred Stock  The Company does not have any preferred stock, authorized or issued.  Warrants  There are currently no outstanding warrants.  Options  There are currently no outstanding options.  Penny Stock Regulations  The ability of an individual shareholder to trade their shares in a particular state may be subject to various rules and regulations of that state. A number of states require that an issuer's securities be registered in their state or appropriately exempted from registration before the securities are permitted to trade in that state. Presently, the Company has no plans to register its securities in any particular state. Further, most likely the Company's shares will be subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the penny stock rule. Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks and Rule 15g-9(d)(1) incorporates the definition of penny stock as that used in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act.      23     Table of Contents  The SEC generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Rule 3a51-1 provides that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is: registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the SEC; authorized for quotation on The NASDAQ Stock Market; issued by a registered investment company; excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share) or the issuer's net tangible assets; or exempted from the definition by the SEC. If the Company's shares are deemed to be a penny stock, trading in the shares will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker- dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors, generally persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse.  For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and must have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock market. A broker- dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade and/or maintain a market in the Company's Common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.  Dividends  The Company has not declared any cash dividends with respect to its common stock and does not intend to declared dividends in the foreseeable future. The future dividend policy of the Company cannot be ascertained with any certainty, and until the Company completes any acquisition, reorganization or merger, as to which no assurance may be given, no such policy will be formulated. There are no material restrictions limiting, or that are likely to limit, the Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock.  Securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans.  None; not applicable   Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers.  None.      24     Table of Contents  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.  We are currently not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject, nor are we aware of any such proceedings that are contemplated by any governmental authority.  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS  The Nevada Private Corporation Law and our Articles of Incorporation allow us to indemnify our officers and directors from certain liabilities and our By-Laws state that we shall indemnify every present or former director or officer of ours or one of our subsidiaries (each an Indemnitee).  Our By-Laws provide for indemnification for liability, including expenses incurred in connection with a claim of liability arising from having been an officer or director of the Company for any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by any such person acting as an officer or director, not involving gross negligence or willful misconduct by such person.  Other than discussed above, none of our By-Laws, or Articles of Incorporation includes any specific indemnification provisions for our officers or directors against liability under the Securities Act. Additionally, insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.     ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES  Shares Issued in Connection with the Share Exchange  On December 26, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of STGI were exchanged for 427,568,548 newly-issued shares of common stock of the Company. This transaction was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as not involving any public offering and/or Regulation S under the Securities Act. None of the shares were sold through an underwriter and accordingly, there were no discounts or commissions involved.  Sales of Unregistered Securities of ADVV  None.

Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.On November 28, 2018, in connection with the completion of the acquisition of Aetna Inc. (Aetna) by CVS Health Corporation (CVS Health), Aetna paid in full all amounts owing under the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of March 27, 2012, as previously amended, among Aetna, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement).  At the time of payment, the Credit Agreement, other than certain indemnity obligations, and all commitments to extend further credit under the Credit Agreement were terminated.Section 2 - Financial InformationItem 2.01.Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.On November 26, 2018, each of Aetna and CVS Health disclosed that they had received all regulatory approvals required to complete CVS Healths acquisition of Aetna.On November 28, 2018 (the Closing Date), Aetna and CVS Health completed the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated as of December 3, 2017, among CVS Health, Hudson Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Health (Merger Sub), and Aetna.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into Aetna (the Merger), with Aetna continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of CVS Health.At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each outstanding Aetna common share (such shares, the Common Shares) (other than treasury shares held by Aetna and any shares beneficially owned by CVS Health or any of CVS Healths subsidiaries unless such shares were owned in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of other persons) was converted into the right to receive 0.8378 of a share of CVS Health common stock and $145.00 in cash without interest thereon (together, the Per Share Merger Consideration).  No fractional shares of CVS Health common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Aetnas former shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of CVS Health common stock.Each outstanding Aetna equity award that was vested or that became vested pursuant to its terms as of the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration or a payment in cash in an amount based on the value of the Per Share Merger Consideration less any applicable exercise price (except for restricted stock units held by Aetnas former non-employee directors, which were converted into the right to receive a payment in cash in an amount based on the closing trading price of Common Shares on the Closing Date).  Each outstanding Aetna equity award that was not vested as of the Effective Time or that was granted after the date of the Merger Agreement was cancelled and converted into a CVS Health equity award, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Aetna equity award immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the performance goals for performance-based awards deemed achieved at the higher of target or actual performance), except that the number of shares of CVS Health common stock subject to each converted CVS Health equity award equals the product of the number of Common Shares underlying each such award at the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio of 2.729.  The applicable exercise price of any converted Aetna equity award was also adjusted to take account of the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.In connection with the Merger, CVS Health issued approximately 274.4 million shares of CVS Health common stock and paid an aggregate of approximately $48.1 billion in cash to former Aetna shareholders in exchange for their Common Shares and to former Aetna equity award holders in exchange for their vested equity awards, resulting in aggregate merger consideration to Aetnas former shareholders and equity award holders of approximately $70 billion, calculated based on the closing price of CVS Health common stock on November 27, 2018.  CVS Health funded the cash portion of the purchase price through a combination of existing cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of debt and term loans.The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. -1-Section 3 - Securities and Trading MarketsItem 3.01.

Coretz, as Sellers Representative (Sellers Representative), pursuant to which the Company purchased (the Acquisition) from Sellers, through three newly-organized acquisition subsidiaries, all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Omni Air International, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (Omni), Omni Aviation Leasing, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (OAL), and T7 Aviation Leasing, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (T7, and together with Omni and OAL, the Target Companies). The Target Companies are engaged, together with Advanced Flight Services, Inc. (the Subsidiary), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Omni, in the business of providing passenger airlift services to the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, worldwide full service commercial passenger charter, wet lease and aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance services and other air transportation services to commercial customers.  The Target Companies and the Subsidiary are referred to herein collectively, as the Acquired Companies.The purchase price for the Acquisition (the Aggregate Purchase Price) was an amount equal to $845 million plus the cash balances of the Acquired Companies as of 11:59 P.M. (Central Time) on the day immediately prior to the date of the closing (the Closing) of the Acquisition (the Measurement Time), minus the indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of the Measurement Time (the Closing Indebtedness), minus the transaction expenses of the Acquired Companies and Sellers related to the Acquisition, including fees and expenses of attorneys, investment bankers, accountants and other service providers (the Transaction Expenses), minus certain bonus or change of control payments triggered by the Acquisition (the Closing Bonus Payments) and plus or minus, as applicable, the amount of any net working capital adjustment (the Net Working Capital Adjustment) based upon the difference between the actual working capital amount of the Acquired Companies as of the Measurement Time (the Closing Net Working Capital) and a target working capital amount set forth in the Purchase Agreement. At the Closing, the Company paid to Sellers the estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, less the Escrow Amount (as defined below). At the Closing, the Company also paid or caused to be paid the Closing Indebtedness, the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Bonus Payments and, to the Escrow Agent (as defined below), the Escrow Amount.  Within 60 days after the date of the Closing, the Company will prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative a written statement setting forth the Companys calculations of the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital and the Net Working Capital Adjustment. The Sellers Representative will then have 30 days after receipt of such calculations to inform the Company whether he agrees or disagrees with the Companys calculations. The Purchase Agreement sets forth a process for resolving any disputes with respect to such calculations. Upon final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Aggregate Purchase Price will be recalculated using the finally determined amounts resulting in an adjustment of the Aggregate Purchase Price (the Purchase Price Adjustment). If the Aggregate Purchase Price, as recalculated, is greater than the estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, the Company will pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers Representative the amount of any such excess, for distribution to the Sellers.  If the Aggregate Purchase Price, as recalculated, is less than such estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, Sellers will pay or cause to be paid to the Company the amount of such deficiency.  If the Aggregate Purchase Price, as recalculated, is equal to the estimated Aggregate Purchase Price, no further payments will be payable by the Company or the Sellers. At the Closing, $18,000,000 of the Purchase Price was deposited in cash with a bank selected by the parties (the Escrow Agent) into two separate escrow accounts: (i) $3,000,000 (the Working Capital Escrow Amount) was deposited in an escrow account to cover amounts that may be owing by Sellers to the Company as a result of the Purchase Price Adjustment and (ii) $15,000,000 (the Indemnification Escrow Amount) was deposited in an escrow account to satisfy claims for indemnification by the Company or other Company indemnitees as a result of  breaches of representations and warranties or covenants of the Sellers contained in the Purchase Agreement. The Working Capital Escrow Amount will be distributed in accordance with the joint written instruction of the Company and Sellers Representative to the Escrow Agent. The Indemnification Escrow Amount (less any amount that has been previously paid from the Indemnification Escrow Amount and amounts subject to pending indemnification claims) will be distributed to the Sellers Representative upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a joint written instruction from the Company and the Sellers Representative fourteen (14) months following the Closing. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company and Sellers. The Company and Sellers have agreed to indemnify each other (and certain related parties) for breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants and certain other matters. Certain representations and warranties of Sellers, including representations and warranties related to the valid organization of the Acquired Companies, Sellers authority to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the validity and binding effect of the Purchase Agreement and related agreements, the capitalization of the Acquired Companies and the ownership of the equity interests of the Acquired Companies, will survive indefinitely (the Fundamental Representations). Certain representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers related to taxes will survive until ninety (90) days after the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation with respect to such representations, warranties and covenants. Representations and warranties related to environmental, health and safety matters will survive until the third anniversary of the Closing. All other representations and warranties in the Purchase Agreement will survive until fourteen (14) months after the Closing. With respect to any other covenant or agreement contained in the Purchase Agreement that contemplates performance after the Closing, such covenant or agreement will survive in accordance with its respective terms in the Purchase Agreement.The maximum indemnification provided by Sellers to the Company and other Company indemnitees with respect to breaches of representations and warranties (other than Fundamental Representations) is $15,000,000. The aggregate amount of the Sellers indemnity obligations shall not exceed the Aggregate Purchase Price paid to Sellers. The Company may not assert a claim for indemnification for breach of a representation and warranty of Sellers in the Purchase Agreement, other than Fundamental Representations and certain other specified representations, until the aggregate amount of damages to which the Company would otherwise be entitled to indemnification exceeds $3,000,000, and then only to the extent of the amount in excess of $3,000,000. At the Closing, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with certain equityholders of each Seller pursuant to which such equityholders guaranteed the payment of Sellers obligations for indemnification amounts as a result of breaches of Fundamental Representations and representations concerning tax matters and breaches of covenants in the Purchase Agreement should the Company be unable to obtain payment for such breaches after seeking to collect payment from Sellers due to insufficient funds being available from the Indemnification Escrow Amount or the inability or refusal of Sellers to honor their obligations under the Purchase Agreement to make payment to the Company. Item2.03Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.On November 9, 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Senior Credit Agreement) with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A. and PNC Bank, National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents, Regions Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Branch Banking and Trust Company, as Co-Documentation Agent, and the other lenders from time to time a party thereto. The Senior Credit Agreement amends and restates the Companys credit agreement, dated May 31, 2016 (the Prior Credit Agreement), with the same Administrative Agent,  Regions Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the Syndication Agents thereunder, Bank of America, N.A., as the Documentation Agent thereunder and the lenders party thereto. The Senior Credit Agreement is in an aggregate principal amount of $1.28 billion, consisting of (i) a $545 million secured revolving credit facility (the Revolver), which did not increase from the Prior Credit Agreement, (ii) a $60 million secured term loan, representing the balance of the term loan owing under the Prior Credit Agreement (the Term A-1 Loan) and (iii) a new $675 million secured term loan (the Term A-2 Loan, and together with the Term A-1 Loan and the Revolver, collectively, the Senior Loans). The Revolver contains a $75 million letter of credit sub-facility, which is the same amount as the letter of credit sub-facility under the Prior Credit Agreement. Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. (CAM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the borrower on the Senior Loans. The Senior Loans each bear interest at a floating rate of (a) LIBOR plus (b) a margin that adjusts from time to time based on the ratio of the Companys consolidated secured debt to consolidated EBITDA. As of November 9, 2018, the applicable interest rate was 4.57% per annum. The proceeds of the Senior Loans were or will be used to pay a portion of the cash purchase price of the Acquisition discussed in Item 2.01 above and for working capital purposes. The Senior Credit Agreement has an incremental facility in which CAM has the right to increase from time to time, upon satisfaction of certain conditions including approval of the lenders, the total amount of the Senior Loans by up to $400 million in aggregate for all such increases. The maturity date of the Senior Loans is May 30, 2023. The Term A-1 Loan will amortize in quarterly payments on the last day of each quarter, beginning on December 31, 2018, each in the amount of $3.75 million through and including March 31, 2023, with the balance due on May 30, 2023. The Term A-2 Loan will amortize in quarterly payments on the last day of each quarter, beginning on March 31, 2019, each in the amount equal to (a) $4,218,750 through December 31, 2019, (b) $8,437,500 through December 31, 2022 and (c) $12,656,250 on March 31, 2023, with the balance due on May 30, 2023.The Senior Loans are secured by substantially all of the Boeing 777, 767 and 757 aircraft of CAM, OAL and T7, and guaranteed by the Company and all present and future, direct and indirect, domestic subsidiaries of the Company other than CAM but including, after giving effect to the Acquisition, the Target Companies (collectively, the Guarantors). The Guarantors have each granted a security interest in any current or future ownership interest in such aircraft. Further, CAMs FAA Aircraft Security Agreements from the Prior Credit Agreement remain in place, and CAM and certain of the Target Companies will grant security interests in such additional aircraft as needed pursuant to separate FAA Aircraft Security Agreements. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including affirmative and negative covenants that in certain circumstances, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, enter into mergers or consolidations or liquidate, dissolve or dispose of assets, to change the nature of their businesses, declare or pay dividends on or repurchase capital stock, grant additional liens and make loans and investments. The Senior Credit Agreement also requires that the Company maintain specified financial ratios and minimum collateral values and satisfy certain financial condition tests including (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio, tested quarterly, of not less than 1.25 to 1.00, (ii) a secured leverage ratio, tested quarterly, not to exceed 3.5 to 1.0, (iii) a total leverage ratio, tested quarterly, not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00, (iv) the ratio of aggregate qualified aircraft collateral value to outstanding loans under the Senior Credit Agreement to be, at all times, not less than 1.10 to 1.00 through and including December 30, 2019, 1.15 to 1.00 from December 31, 2019 through and including December 30, 2020, and 1.25 to 1.00 on and after December 31, 2020, in each case subject to a cure period to add additional qualified aircraft, and (v) the ratio of aggregate qualified aircraft collateral value to outstanding loans plus unused commitments under the Senior Credit Agreement to be, at all times, not less than 0.50 to 1.00, subject to a cure period to add additional qualified aircraft. In addition to certain other specifically permitted indebtedness, the Senior Credit Agreement increases the general basket of additional permitted indebtedness which can be incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries from $300 million to $500 million. The Senior Credit Agreement contains certain events of default customary for financings of this type, including failure to pay principal or interest, breaches of representations and warranties, failure to observe covenants and other terms of the Senior Credit Agreement and the Senior Loans, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, bankruptcy, insolvency, invalidity of lien position, various ERISA violations, the incurrence of material judgments and changes in control. If an event of default occurs under the Senior Credit Agreement and is not cured within any applicable grace period and is not waived, the Administrative Agent and the lenders are entitled to take various actions, including, without limitation, the acceleration of amounts due thereunder, termination of commitments under the Senior Credit Agreement and realization upon the collateral securing the Senior Loans.Item7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.On November 9, 2018, the Company issued a press release announcing the Closing.

Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreement  Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets  Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities  On December 3, 2018, we entered into a Capital Contribution Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with our president and principal shareholder, Robert Qin Peng (\"Peng\"). Under the terms of the Agreement, Peng contributed certain assets of eVeek, LLC (\"eVeek\"), a developer of iOS and Android applications and games, to our company, in exchange for the issuance of an addition 8,000 shares of common stock of our company to Peng (the \"Acquisition\"). To determine the number of shares received by Peng in connection with such contribution, our company valued the contributed eVeek assets at $40,000 and divided this amount by a price per share equal to $5.00, which represents the most recent price per share for trades of our company's common stock on the Over-the-Counter Quotation system in which our company's common stock is quoted. In connection with the Agreement, our company assumed certain ongoing responsibilities of eVeek, including maintaining Apple and Google developer licenses.  The assets contributed to our company consist of a significant portion of the assets used in the operation of the eVeek business, with the exception of one application on eVeeks' Google Play account and three applications on eVeeks' iTunes account.      3     Table of Contents  Description of Business  Overview  We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 19, 2016. Our principal executive office is located at Calle Duarte, No. 6, Sosua, Dominican Republic, our telephone number is 829-217-2262.  Our shares of common stock are quoted on the Over-the-Counter-Bulletin-Board (\"OTCBB\") under the symbol \"AGGG\".  On May 31, 2018, in connection with a private transaction, the control block of voting stock of our company, represented by 2,985,000 shares of common stock, was transferred from Ramon Perez Conception to Greenwich Holdings Limited, resulting in a change of control of our company and the resignation of Ramon Perez Conception as President, Secretary, Treasurer and director and the appointment of Robert Qin Peng as President, Secretary, Treasurer and director of our company.  Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.  We do not have any subsidiaries.  Previous Business  From inception until the Acquisition, we were in the business of selling used automobiles that we purchased in the United States to customers in the USA and Dominican Republic. We purchased our automobiles primarily at used car stores, private sellers, dealer-auctions and sell them to private buyers or other car dealers in the USA and Dominican Republic.  Current Business  On November 1, 2018, our company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles in the United States and Dominican Republic. Upon the change of control of our company, management began to seek a new business direction for our company. With the contribution by Robert Qin Peng of the eVeek assets, we now have a portfolio of iOS and Android applications (apps) and games (collectively the \"Apps\"). We will adopt different monetization strategies with each of our apps and games  some monetize using only ads, some have both ads and in-app purchases and some are paid apps. Consumers download our Apps through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.  Android Apps and Games  Our Android portfolio includes 6 games and 2 apps.  iOS Apps and Games  Our iPhone iOS portfolio includes 5 games and 1 app.  Our iPad iOS portfolio includes 5 games and 1 app.  We currently generate revenue from sales of our paid Apps and minimal revenue from advertisements published on certain Apps. A primary focus for us during the next 12 months is on developing new Apps and modifying existing Apps that we believe can generate increased revenue.       4     Table of Contents  Our employee devotes only 10 hours per week to our affairs and provides services to others in the business of developing, marketing and selling mobile applications. There can be no assurance that concepts for mobile applications developed by our employee will be presented to our company for consideration. With respect to any new applications developed by our employee, our company's position is that nay such applications developed while they are using the resources of our company, will be owned by our company. At this time, we do not believe that the applications our employee will develop for our company will fall within the types of applications they may develop for other companies. However, no assurance can be given that a conflict will not arise over ownership of the applications developed by our employee, or that they will not become associated with another company that develops applications similar to those of our company. In either event, our company may not have rights to the applications developed by our employee that our company believes we are entitled to own. In the event of a conflict over ownership of applications developed by our employee, our company intends to enter into discussion to resolve the conflict amicably prior to any legal rights or remedies that may be available to our company.   Competition  Management believes that the Apps have the following strengths and weaknesses, relative to the competition in the market:  Strengths and Opportunities  Unique and novel apps and reliable source codes. The market currently includes many apps which are copycat apps; our Apps however are original and novel in their category.  We believe that we can increase our revenue from the development of new apps and improving certain apps that already exist within our portfolio.  Weaknesses  Lack of marketing: Our most significant weakness is that we have never had sufficient capital to undertake any amount of marketing. If we are unable to generate proceeds from the sale of the shares offered under this offering, we will not have funds to be used in marketing to grow our business.  Android and iOS updates. So far the Apps have been updated to the latest available versions in their respective Android and iOS platforms, but future updates could break some functionalities. With each update, some of our Apps functionalities become unusable and we must then update our Apps to cure such broken functionalities. Typically, users of Android devices download new operating systems at slow pace and therefore it is anticipated that it will take at least 2 years for the effects to be realized.  Workability. We cannot guarantee that we can make all of our Apps will work with all versions of Android or Apple devices. Therefore, we must predict how our customer base will adopt new Android and iOS operating system versions and modify our Apps to work with the highest percentage of our customers devices.  Target Market  We are focused on operating through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.  Sales & Marketing  Pricing Strategy  We primarily offer free Apps. We have currently have one paid App which is priced at $2.99. This price is seen as optimal for the current type of App. However, changes in the market happen quickly and this pricing could become obsolete or a detriment to our growth.  Marketing Strategy  Of the majority of the Apps we will develop, we intend to offer a free basic version to advertise for a paid premium version of the same App. We believe that free Apps will create the most opportunities for downloads of our Apps.      5     Table of Contents  We will study analytics related to number of downloads of our Apps, daily rankings of our Apps in the Apple App Store and Amazon App Store, how often users use the Apps after purchasing, and sales of Apps. We will use the analytics to make changes to our Apps in an effort to increase sales of the Apps.  We also intend to utilize Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in an effort to build a customer base for our Apps.  Legal Proceedings  From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not involved in any pending legal proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are a party and which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. To date, our company has never been involved in litigation, as either a party or a witness, nor has our company been involved in any legal proceedings commenced by any regulatory agency against our company.  Emerging Growth Company Status  We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:       1.  The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;         2.  The last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;         3.  The date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non- convertible debt; or         4.  The date on which such issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.  As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.  As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.  We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.      6     Table of Contents  Risk Factors  Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this current report, including our financial statements and the related notes attached as exhibits, before making any decision to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, you could lose some or all of your investment in our common stock.  Risks Related to our Business  Our ability to operate as a going concern is in doubt  The audit opinion and notes that accompany our financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2018, disclose a 'going concern' qualification to our ability to continue in business. The accompany statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. We have incurred losses since our inception. We do not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet debt obligations for the next 12 months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and raising additional funds.  We currently are not profitable and our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise capital to fund our future operations and working capital requirements or our ability to make positive progress in executing our business plan. Our plans for mitigating the going concern qualification include financing our future operations through sales of our common stock and/or debt and the eventual profitable operations of our business. The uncertainty of our achievement of these factors raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Apple and Google, our business will suffer.  The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are our primary distribution, marketing, promotion and payment platform for our Apps. We expect to generate substantially all of our revenue through those platforms for the foreseeable future. Any deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google would harm our business and adversely affect the value of our stock.  We are subject to Apples and Googles standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on their platform.  Our business would be harmed if:       Apple or Google discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other app developers;     Apple or Google removes one of our revenue-producing Apps from their store;     Apple or Google modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the their platform or shared by users from Apple's and Googles strong brand recognition and large user base.  If Apple or Google lose their market position or otherwise fall out of favor with Internet users, we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our Apps, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us.  We operate in a new and rapidly changing industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.      7     Table of Contents  Mobile apps, from which we expect to derive all of our revenue, is a new and rapidly evolving industry. The growth of the mobile app industry and the level of demand and market acceptance of our Apps are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Our future operating results will depend on numerous factors affecting the mobile app industry, many of which are beyond our control, including:       changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;     the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment;     the worldwide growth of personal computer, broadband internet and mobile device users, and the rate of any such growth; and     general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending.  Our ability to plan for app development, distribution and promotional activities will be significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid changes in the tastes and preferences of our current and potential users. New and different types of entertainment may increase in popularity at the expense of mobile apps. A decline in the popularity of apps in general, or our Apps in particular, would harm our business and prospects.  We have a new business model and a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.  We have a short operating history and a new business model, which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects.  Our growth depends on our ability to consistently launch new apps that achieve significant popularity. Each of our Apps requires significant engineering, marketing and other resources to develop, launch and sustain via regular upgrades. Our ability to successfully launch, sustain and expand apps and attract and retain a user-base largely will depend on our ability to:       anticipate and effectively respond to changing app interests and preferences;     anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape;     anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape;     effectively market new apps and enhancements to our existing users and new users;     minimize launch delays and cost overruns on new apps; and     minimize downtime and other technical difficulties.  If our Apps do not maintain their popularity, our results of operations could be harmed.  In addition to creating new apps that are attractive to a significant number of users, we must extend the life of our existing Apps, in particular our most successful Apps. For an App to remain popular, we must constantly enhance, expand or upgrade it with new features users find useful. Such constant enhancement requires the investment of significant resources, particularly with older Apps, and such costs on average have increased. We may not be able to successfully enhance, expand or upgrade our current Apps.  Our Apps target a specific market, and may be negatively impacted by updates to the Android or iOS platform and unfavorable reviews, which could harm our business and results of operations.  Because our Apps are very specific on what they can do there is potential for them to be serving too narrow of a market. Another risk posed to our Apps are updates to the Android and iOS platforms, which could render some of our Apps or their features obsolete. In addition, negative reviews or ratings by app users could lower the number of downloads of our Apps. Each of the foregoing could harm our business and results of operations.  Any failure or significant interruption in our network could impact our operations and harm our business.  Our technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our Apps and to user satisfaction. Our Apps run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. This system is operated by third parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace. We expect this dependence on third parties to continue.      8     Table of Contents  Security breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations.  Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and may occur on our systems in the future. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.  We face significant competition, there are low barriers to entry in the search engine optimization industry, and competition is intense.  The search engine optimization industry is highly competitive, and we expect more competitors to emerge. We face competition from a number of competitors who offer search engine optimization software. Some of these current, emerging and potential competitors have significant resources for developing or acquiring additional software solutions, and have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences, regulations or other developments that may impact the search engine optimization. Increased competition could result in loss of existing customers or reduce our ability to acquire new customers, both of which could harm our business.  There are low barriers to entry in the app industry, and competition is intense.  The app industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of apps to be introduced. In addition, we have limited experience in developing apps for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain. As we continue to devote resources to developing apps for those platforms, we will face significant competition from established companies and new-comers. Some of these current, emerging and potential competitors have significant resources for developing apps, and have a more diversified set of revenue sources than we do and may be less severely affected by changes in consumer preferences, regulations or other developments that may impact the market for mobile apps. Increased competition could result in loss of existing users or reduce our ability to acquire new users, both of which could harm our business.  We may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.  We may face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or settlement we may be obligated to cancel the launch of a new App, stop offering an App or certain features of an App, pay royalties or significant settlement costs, purchase licenses or modify our Apps and features while we develop substitutes.  Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could harm our business and operating results.  We regard the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights as critical to our success and we rely on trade secret protection and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights. However, trade secret protection and copyright law may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others. Further, in some instances we may be required to obtain licenses to intellectual property in lieu of ownership. Such licenses may be limited in scope and require us to renegotiate on a frequent basis for additional use rights. Moreover, to the extent we only have a license to any intellectual property used in our software, there may be no guarantee of continued access to such intellectual property, including on commercially reasonable terms.      9     Table of Contents  We could be required to cease certain activities and/or incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another partys intellectual property rights.  Some of our competitors may own technology patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and website content, which they may use to assert claims against us. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies in the Internet and technology industries are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights. As we face increasing competition and as litigation becomes a more common way to resolve disputes, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to claims that we have misappropriated or misused other parties intellectual property rights. If we are sued by a third party that claims that our technology infringes its rights, the litigation (with or without merit) could be expensive and could divert our management resources.  The results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party may require us to do one or more of the following:       cease making, selling, offering for sale or using technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;     make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;     obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to sell or use the relevant technology; or     redesign technology to avoid infringement.  If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us, such payments or costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial results.  Programming errors or flaws in our Apps could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our Apps, which would harm our operating results.  Our Apps may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after their launch, particularly as we launch new Apps and rapidly release new features to existing Apps under tight time constraints. Further, if we utilize application developers in India and/or China, we believe there is an increased likelihood that our Apps may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data. We believe that if our users have a negative experience with our Apps, they may be less inclined to continue or resume using them or recommend our Apps to other potential users. Undetected programming errors, App defects and data corruption can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the experience of our users.  Our business is subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.  We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export and national security, that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users.  If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our Apps, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.      10     Table of Contents  If we fail to keep up with technological developments and evolving user expectations, we may fail to maintain or attract customers or generate revenues, and our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.  We operate in a market characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, new product and service announcements, new generations of product enhancements and changing user expectations. Accordingly, our performance and the ability to further monetize our Apps will depend on our ability to adapt to these rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, and our ability to continually innovate in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive products. There may be occasions when we may not be as responsive as our competitors in adapting our existing software to changing industry standards and the needs of our users.  We intend to devote resources aimed at developing new software applications and enhancing our existing software. We may not be able to effectively integrate new software applications or enhance our existing software on a timely basis or at all, which may decrease user satisfaction with our services. Such new software applications or enhancements to our existing software, even if developed or integrated, may not function as expected or may be unable to attract and retain a substantial number of users to use our products. Our failure to keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving user expectations may cause us to fail to retain or attract users or generate revenues, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.  We may not attain profitability in the future.  We expect to make significant investments in growing our business and significantly increase our use of independent contractors, which could further reduce our ability to attain profitability. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result of these increased expenditures, our ability to become profitable in the future could become more difficult. In future periods, our revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. We also may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including due to the other risks described in this prospectus, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors. Accordingly, we may not be able to attain profitability, and we may continue to incur losses in the future.  We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, which make our future results difficult to predict.  Our revenue and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenue or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and forecasts, and some of our operating costs are to a large extent fixed in the near term. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue, and even a small shortfall in revenue could adversely affect financial results for that quarter.  Our employee is only part-time and the loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.  We currently depend on the continued services and performance of one part-time employee. The loss of our employee could disrupt our current Apps, delay new app development, and decrease user retention, which would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, as our employee is only part time and is required to only devote ten (10) hours per week to our affairs, it may have a negative impact on our business and planned operations. Further, we cannot any employee from terminating their employment with us at any time.  As we grow, we cannot guarantee we will be able to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.      11     Table of Contents  We will need to continue to expand and enhance our network infrastructure to accommodate the growth of our business.  We rely on our internal network infrastructure to manage our operations and to provide us with the data we need to analyze the performance of our business and to report our operational and financial performance accurately. We plan to invest in expanding and enhancing our network systems which could involve additional purchases of computer hardware and software as well as the hiring of additional operations personnel. We may not be able to successfully install and implement any new computer hardware and software needed to enhance our operational systems and we may not be able to attract a sufficient number of additional qualified operations personnel. If we are unable to successfully expand and enhance our network infrastructure and operational systems, or experience difficulties in implementing such systems, our business could be harmed.  Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.  Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. Additionally, we rely on our network, data centers and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing and operational support activities. In the event of a catastrophic event, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our software development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.  Security breaches could harm our business.  Security breaches have become more prevalent in the technology industry. We believe that we take reasonable steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, use, store and disclose, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent (e.g., software bugs or other technical malfunctions, employee error or malfeasance, or other factors) or unauthorized data access or use will not occur despite our efforts. Although we have not experienced any material security breaches to date, we have in the past experienced and we may in the future experience attempts to disable our systems or to breach the security of our systems. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to personal information, confidential information and/or the systems on which such information are stored and/or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and users and/or suffer other negative consequences to our business. A security breach could adversely affect the user experience and cause the loss or corruption of data, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Any failure to maintain the security of our infrastructure could result in loss of personal information and/or other confidential information, damage to our reputation and user relationships, early termination of our contracts and other business losses, indemnification of our users, financial penalties, litigation, regulatory investigations and other significant liabilities. In the event of a major third-party security incident, we may incur losses in excess of their insurance coverage. Further, we do not have insurance currently, and certain incidents that we can experience may not be covered by any insurance that we may carry in the future.  If we fail to maintain our brand or further develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, our business may suffer.  We believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our Apps and attracting new users. Brand promotion activities may not generate consumer awareness or increase revenue, and even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. In addition, our brand can be harmed if we experience adverse publicity for our Apps for any reason, including due to bugs, outages, security breaches or violations of laws. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain user necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad user adoption of our Apps.      12     Table of Contents  We may need to raise additional funds in the future to achieve our current business strategy and our inability to obtain funding will cause our business to fail.  We may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity sales in order to fund our future operations and fulfill our business plan in the future. These financings may not be available when needed. Even if these financings are available, they may be on terms that we deem unacceptable or are materially adverse to your interests with respect to dilution of book value, dividend preferences, liquidation preferences, or other terms. Our inability to obtain financing could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our current business plan and develop our properties and products, and as a result, could require us to diminish or suspend our operations and possibly cease our existence.  Risks Related to the Acquisition and Ownership of Our Common Stock  There is not now, and there may never be, an active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.  Our common stock is eligible for quotation on OTC Markets, OTCPink (Current Information) tier of OTC Markets Group Inc., an over-the-counter quotation system, and there is not now, nor has there been since our inception, any significant trading activity in our common stock or a market for shares of our common stock, and an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. As a result, investors in our common stock must bear the economic risk of holding those shares for an indefinite period of time. We do not now, and may not in the future, meet the initial listing standards of any national securities exchange, and we presently anticipate that our common stock will be quoted on the OTC Markets in the OTCPink (Current Information) tier or another over-the-counter quotation system in the foreseeable future. In those venues, our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of their shares of our common stock, and may find few buyers to purchase their stock and few market makers to support its price. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price for which you purchased them, at or near quoted bid prices, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional equity in the future, and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using shares of our common stock as consideration.  Our share price is expected to be volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control.  Market prices for shares of mobile application companies such as ours are often volatile, and the trading price of our common stock is therefore likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:        changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;     the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment;     the worldwide growth of personal computer, broadband internet and mobile device users, and the rate of any such growth; and     general economic conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending.     our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and manage such growth;     issuances of debt or equity securities;     sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, or the perception that such sales could occur;     trading volume of our common stock;     ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures;     general political and economic conditions;     effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and     other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.      13     Table of Contents  In addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of small-cap biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition other biotechnology companies or our competitors programs could have positive or negative results that impact their stock prices and their results or stock fluctuations could have a positive or negative impact on our stock price regardless of whether such impact is direct or not. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these Risk Factors, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.  Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.  Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks; and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.  In order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (i) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.  The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (i) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (ii) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.  Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.  FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock.  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our securities, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common stock.      14     Table of Contents  If securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and any trading volume could decline.  Any trading market for our common stock that may develop will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, markets or competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on us or our business. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, and one or more of those analysts downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or our market, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline.  If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors views of us.  We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls. Our management team and Board of Directors will need to devote significant efforts to maintaining adequate and effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with applicable regulations, which may include hiring additional legal, financial reporting and other finance and accounting staff. Additionally, any of our efforts to improve our internal controls and design, implement and maintain an adequate system of disclosure controls may not be successful and will require that we expend significant cash and other resources.  Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, issuers that qualify as emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act will not be required to provide an auditors attestation report on internal controls for so long as the issuer qualifies as an emerging growth company. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, and we may choose not to provide an auditors attestation report on internal controls. However, if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if we require an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm in the future and that firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, investor confidence and, in turn, our stock price could be materially adversely affected.  Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.  We do not have sufficient accounting and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of technical accounting experience and training necessary or adequate accounting policies, processes and procedures, particularly in the areas of revenue recognition, equity related transactions and other complex, judgmental areas for U.S. GAAP financial reporting and SEC reporting purposes and consequently, we must rely on third party consultants. These deficiencies represent a material weakness (as defined under the Exchange Act) in our internal control over financial reporting in both design and operation. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future. Under the Exchange Act, a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls. We are currently developing a plan to design, review, implement and refine internal control over financial reporting. However, we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses or fail to remediate previously identified deficiencies in our internal controls. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.      15     Table of Contents  We are not subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures and as a result our stockholders have limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rule changes enacted by the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Stock Market as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley, require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance. These measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities which are listed on those exchanges. Because we are not presently required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions we have not yet adopted these measures. As a result, we do not yet have an audit or compensation committee. Until we comply with such corporate governance measures, regardless of whether such compliance is required, the absence of such standards of corporate governance may leave our stockholders without protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters.  We do not have a class of our securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Until we do or we become subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we will be a voluntary filer.  We are not currently required under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act to file periodic reports with the SEC. We have in the past voluntarily elected to file some or all of these reports to ensure that sufficient information about us and our operations is publicly available to our stockholders and potential investors. Because we are a voluntary filer, we are considered a non-reporting issuer under the Exchange Act. Until we become subject to the reporting rules under the Exchange Act, we are not required to file annual, quarterly or current reports and could cease doing so at any time. Additionally, until we register a class of our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, we are not subject to the SECs proxy rules, and large holders of our capital stock will not be subject to beneficial ownership reporting requirements under Sections 13 or 16 of the Exchange Act and their related rules. As a result, our stockholders and potential investors may not have available to them as much or as robust information as they may have if and when we become subject to those requirements.  Our principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.  Certain of our principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock. As of the date of this report, our holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially own approximately 70% of our outstanding voting stock (which includes shares they have the right to acquire within 60 days), after giving effect to the Acquisition. Accordingly, our large stockholders have significant influence over our affairs due to their substantial ownership, and have substantial voting power to approve matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that some of our stockholders may believe is in their best interest.  If we issue additional shares of our capital stock in the future, our existing stockholders will be diluted.  Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 75,000,000 shares of our common. Possible business and financial uses for our authorized capital stock include, without limitation, equity financing, future stock splits, acquiring other companies, businesses or products in exchange for shares of our capital stock, issuing shares of our capital stock to partners or other collaborators in connection with strategic alliances, attracting and retaining employees by the issuance of additional securities under our equity compensation plan, or other transactions and corporate purposes that our Board of Directors deems are in the interests of our company. Additionally, issuances of shares of our capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or our management. Any future issuances of shares of our capital stock may not be made on favorable terms or at all, they may have rights, preferences and privileges that are superior to those of our common stock, and may have an adverse effect on our business or the trading price of our common stock. The issuance of any additional shares of our common stock will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Additionally, any such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all of our current stockholders.      16     Table of Contents  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price to fall.  If our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the legal restrictions on resale discussed in this report lapse or after those shares become registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration statement, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of the date of this current report, a total of 4,290,000 shares of our common stock are outstanding. Of those shares, only approximately 1,305,000 are currently freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market. If we were to elect to file a registration statement with respect to outstanding shares of our common stock, those shares that become registered would be freely tradable without restriction, except for shares held by our affiliates, and any sales of those shares or any perception in the market that such sales may occur could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.  In addition, shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules, Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and any future registration of such shares under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.  The elimination of personal liability of our directors and officers under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenses.  Our Bylaws eliminate to the furthest extent permitted under Nevada law the personal liability of our directors and officers to us, our stockholders and creditors for damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer. Further, our Bylaws provide that we are obligated to indemnify, subject to certain exceptions, each of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by Nevada law and, subject to certain conditions, to advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could expose us to substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to afford. Further, those provisions and resulting costs may discourage us or our stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for such damages, even if such actions might otherwise benefit our stockholders.  We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.  We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that the Board of Directors deems relevant. Our stockholders should not expect that we will ever pay cash or other dividends on our outstanding capital stock.  We are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.  We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what is available with respect to other public companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.      17     Table of Contents  Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. Since we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with the effective dates of those accounting standards.  We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (2) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (3) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or (4) January 31, 2023, the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an emerging growth company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.  We are a smaller reporting company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.  We are currently a smaller reporting company, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, at such time we cease being an emerging growth company, we will be required to provide additional disclosure in our SEC filings. However, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and in a registration statement under the Exchange Act on Form 10. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.  Description of Property  Our principal executive office is located at Calle Duarte, No. 6, Sosua, Dominican Republic, our telephone number is 829-217-2262.  Employees  We currently have one part-time employee. Our employee is only part time and is required to only devote ten (10) hours per week to our affairs, it may have a negative impact on our business and planned operations. Further, we cannot any employee from terminating their employment with us at any time  Financial Information  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this report. The managements discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words believe, plan, intend, anticipate, target, estimate, expect and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions (will, may, could, should, etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under Risk Factors in this Form 8-K, that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Companys actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.      18     Table of Contents  As the result of the change in business and operations of the Company, a discussion of the past, pre-acquisition financial results of the Company is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles the historical financial results of eVeeks assets as acquired by Antilia Group, Corp.  The following discussion highlights eVeeks results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on eVeeks audited and unaudited financial statements contained in this Current Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.  Going Concern  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating operating cash flow and raising capital sufficient to fund operations. We have discussed our strategy and plans relating to these matters elsewhere in this Current Report although the consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  Results of Operations  Comparison for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 for the operations of eVeek.

The decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in customer demand for online mobile apps.  During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we generated $3,039 in revenue, compared to $6,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in customer demand for online mobile apps.  OPERATING EXPENSES  During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we incurred $754 in general and administrative costs, compared to $439 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was due to general maintenance costs.  During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we incurred $694 in general and administrative costs, compared to $0 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was due to general maintenance costs.  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2018, we had cash on hand of $0. We will need to raise additional capital as revenue from operations are not expected to be able to support the cash required to fully execute our business plan.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements.  Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices  We do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition during the past two years.  Critical Accounting Policies  Critical accounting policies are those that require application of our managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments often as a need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The most significant estimates in our financial statements are discussed below. Actual results could vary from those estimates.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments. We do not currently have any accounting estimates.      20     Table of Contents  Financial Instruments  The Company follows ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\", which defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  Level 1  Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2  Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.  Level 3  Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606,\"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\"  Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:        identify the contract with a customer;     identify the performance obligations in the contract;     determine the transaction price;     allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and     recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue related to multi-media downloads is recognized when the above criteria are met.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014 and again in August 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. The objective of the new guidance is to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2019. Early adoption is permitted, but only beginning in 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its financial statements.      21     Table of Contents  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  Not required.  INTEREST RATE  Interest rates are generally controlled. We may need to increase our reliance on bank financing or other debt instruments in the future in which case fluctuations in interest rates could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management  The following table sets forth, as of December 3, 2018, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common and preferred shares by each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common and preferred shares, as well as by each of our current directors and executive officers as a group. Each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares of common and preferred stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common and preferred stock, except as otherwise indicated.     Name and Address of Beneficial Owner    Amount and Nature ofBeneficial Ownership     Percentageof Class(1)      Greenwich Holdings Limited (2) Global Gateway 8 Rue la de Perte Providence Mahe Seychelles    2,985,000 Common Shares     69.58 %   Directors and Executive Officers as a Group    2,985,000 Common Shares     69.58 % ____________    (1)  Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on December 3, 2018. As of December 3, 2018 there were 4,290,000 shares of our companys common stock issued and outstanding.   (2)  Greenwich Holdings Limited is a company over which Robert Qin Peng, our sole officer and directors, holds sole voting and dispositive power.  Changes in Control  We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement or provisions of our Articles or Bylaws the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our company. There are not any provisions in our Articles or Bylaws, the operation of which would delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company.  Directors and Executive Officers      22     Table of Contents  All directors of our company hold office until the next annual meeting of the security holders or until their successors have been elected and qualified. The officers of our company are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until their death, resignation or removal from office. Our directors and executive officers, their ages, positions held, and duration as such, are as follows:     Name   Position Held with the Company   Age   Date First Elected or Appointed   Robert Qin Peng   President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director   33   May 31, 2018  Business Experience  The following is a brief account of the education and business experience during at least the past five years of each director, executive officer and key employee of our company, indicating the persons principal occupation during that period, and the name and principal business of the organization in which such occupation and employment were carried out.  Robert Qin Peng  President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director  Robert Qin Peng was an Assistant Vice President of Portfolio Management Finance at Guangxi Jianghong Investment Co., Ltd., where he was responsible for financial and investor reporting as well as tax and accounting review of lower and upper tier projections.

NRS 78.7502 permits a corporation to indemnify any director or officer of the corporation against expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding brought by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, if such person (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 and (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. In a derivative action (i.e., one brought by or on behalf of the corporation), indemnification may be provided only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred by any director or officer in connection with the defense or settlement of such an action or the suit if such person (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 and (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be provided if such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought or some other court of competent jurisdiction determines that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.

The Companys fiscal year end is December 31.  The Company generates revenue from the download of mobile applications.  NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are presented in US dollars.   The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-05, of Regulation X, and Rule 8-04, as carve-out financial statements for an acquired business or group of assets that does not constitute the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the selling entity.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.  Accounts receivable  Accounts receivable is received typically on the 21st or 22nd of the subsequent month. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized no bad debt or allowance.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606,\"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\"  Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:        identify the contract with a customer;     identify the performance obligations in the contract;     determine the transaction price;     allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and     recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.      31     Table of Contents  Revenue related to multi-media downloads is recognized when the above criteria are met.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FASB ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.  If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Recent accounting pronouncements  Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Companys management believes that recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.  NOTE 3  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, related party collected accounts receivable of $13,478 and $23,962, respectively, on behalf of the Company. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company recorded receivable  related party of $55,012 and $41,534, respectively.  NOTE 4  INCOME TAXES  From inception to September 30, 2018, the Companys owners were attributed with taxable income, as the Company operates as a Limited Liability Corporation whereby the owners are attributed taxable income personally. The Company does not have an income tax expense accrual as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017, as the Companys net income liabilities are attributed personally to the owners. No income tax provision has been recorded as of September 30, 2018 or December 31, 2017.  NOTE 5  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS      32     Table of Contents  In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to September 30, 2018 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Audited December 31, 2017 Financial Statements  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the shareholders and the board of directors of Eveek  Opinion on the Financial Statements  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Eveek (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Basis for Opinion  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.   Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

The Companys fiscal year end is December 31.  The Company generates revenue from the download of mobile applications.  NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are presented in US dollars. The Companys fiscal year-end is December 31.  The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-05, of Regulation X, and Rule 8-04, as carve-out financial statements for an acquired business or group of assets that does not constitute the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the selling entity.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts for certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these good faith estimates and judgments.  Accounts receivable  Accounts receivable is received typically on the 21st or 22nd of the subsequent month. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Reserves are recorded primarily on a specific identification basis. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized no bad debt or allowance.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606,\"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\"  Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:       identify the contract with a customer;     identify the performance obligations in the contract;     determine the transaction price;     allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and     recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.      38     Table of Contents Revenue related to multi-media downloads is recognized when the above criteria are met.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  ASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. FASB ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.  If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Recent accounting pronouncements  Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Companys management believes that recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.  NOTE 3  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, related party collected accounts receivable of $30,414 and $10,846, respectively, on behalf of the Company. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded receivable  related party of $41,534 and $11,120, respectively.  NOTE 4  INCOME TAXES  From inception to December 31, 2017, the Companys owners were attributed with taxable income , as the Company operates as a Limited Liability Corporation whereby the owners are attributed taxable income personally. The Company does not have an income tax expense accrual as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016, as the Companys net income liabilities are attributed personally to the owners. No income tax provision has been recorded as of December 31, 2017, or 2016.  NOTE 5  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to December 31, 2017 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.      39     Table of Contents  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  In the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there have been no changes in our company's accounting policies, nor have there been any disagreements with our accountants.

These parties have received, and in the future may receive, compensation from the Company for these services.The Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement are attached hereto, respectively, as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2. The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits.Item 2.01Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.On December 19, 2018 (the Closing Date), the Company completed the acquisition of PlanGrid, a Delaware corporation (PlanGrid). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Araujo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), PlanGrid, and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the securityholders agent, Merger Sub merged with and into PlanGrid, with PlanGrid continuing as the 4surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger), for a total purchase price of $875 million, net of cash, subject to customary adjustments.Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock and preferred stock of PlanGrid issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive the applicable consideration calculated as set forth in the Merger Agreement, without interest, and was automatically cancelled and retired and ceased to exist. In addition, each option to purchase shares of common stock of PlanGrid that was vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time and each restricted stock unit settleable for shares of common stock of PlanGrid that was vested, outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the effective time was, as of the effective time, converted into the right to receive the applicable consideration calculated as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and was automatically cancelled and retired and ceased to exist. Each option to purchase shares of common stock of PlanGrid and each restricted stock unit settleable for shares of common stock of PlanGrid that was held by a continuing service provider and was unvested, outstanding and unexercised or unsettled immediately prior to the effective time was assumed by the Company and became an option to purchase, or a restricted stock unit settleable for, shares of common stock of the Company.

It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or PlanGrid. The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by certain of the parties to the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement were the product of negotiations among the parties and made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts; and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or PlanGrid or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants changed after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys public disclosures.

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement as originally executed on September 26, 2018, which was filed as Annex A to the Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference.Item 1.01.  Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.On November 6, 2018, Contura, Alpha and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (the WVDEP) entered into a binding term sheet agreement (the Term Sheet) to resolve certain issues related to the issuance of the Dividend under the Permitting and Reclamation Plan Settlement Agreement for the State of West Virginia dated as of July 12, 2016 (amended by the First Amendment dated July 25, 2016 and by the Second Amendment dated October 23, 2017, the Amended Settlement Agreement).Pursuant to the Term Sheet, the WVEP provided its consent to the Dividend and acknowledged in accordance with the Amended Settlement Agreement that it had determined that the successor entities that will exist following the Mergers have the ability to complete all reclamation, mitigation and water management and treatment obligations in West Virginia required under the Amended Settlement Agreement.  Upon consummation of the Mergers, WVDEP and Alpha agreed to enter into a third amendment to the Amended Settlement Agreement, which amendment will delete a provision in the Amended Settlement Agreement prohibiting the issuance of dividends by Alpha prior to the satisfaction of certain obligations of Alpha under the Amended Settlement Agreement.The Term Sheet also provides for the extension of the first lien mortgage and deed of trust in an office and associated real estate in Julian, West Virginia previously granted by ANR to the WVDEP to secure ANRs obligations under the Amended Settlement Agreement until ANR and Contura complete the payments required under the Reclamation Funding Agreement dated as of July 12, 2016, by and among, ANR, Contura, WVDEP, and the regulatory agencies of Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia (the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement).  Contura is also obligated under the Term Sheet to continue to hold subject to the applicable Deposit Account Control Agreements referenced in the Amendment of Agreements dated as of October 23, 2017 by and between Contura and the WVDEP approximately $2.8 million of certain cash collateral until ANR and Contura complete the payments required of them under the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement.Concurrent with ANRs issuance of the Dividend, pursuant to the Term Sheet Contura agreed to either post cash collateral with WVDEP or cause a letter of credit to be issued to WVDEP, in each case in the amount of $9 million, to secure Conturas and ANRs payment obligations under the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement and the Amended Settlement Agreement (the Payment Obligations) until a performance bond is issued as described in the second following sentence.  On November 8, 2018, Contura posted the $9 million cash collateral. Within 45 days of the issuance of the Dividend, Contura is required under the Term Sheet to issue a performance bond to WVDEP in the amount of $35 million to secure the Payment Obligations.  The amount of such performance bond will decrease on a dollar to dollar basis after the Payment Obligations fall below $35 million.  If the performance bond is not issued within 45 days, Contura must post additional cash collateral or cause an additional letter of credit to be issued, in each case in an amount equal to $26 million, until the performance bond is issued.  Under the Term Sheet, Contura has also agreed that, prior to making any dividend payment to its shareholders, it will provide evidence to the WVDEP that, inclusive of the effect of paying the dividend, Contura will have remaining total liquidity that is greater than or equal to the total amount of the remaining payment obligations of ANR and Contura under the Amended Reclamation Funding Agreement.  The WVDEP may draw on the aforementioned performance bond in the event Contura issues a dividend in violation of the agreement in the preceding sentence, with such draw being in an amount equal to the difference between the amount owed to the WVDEP at the time of the dividend payment and the amount of liquidity remaining immediately after such payment.The above summary of the Term Sheet is not a complete description thereof and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 and incorporated herein by reference.In addition, the information set forth under Item 2.03 is incorporated herein by reference.Item 2.01.

On October 10, 2018, Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (the \"Company\"), and Bank of America, N.A. (\"BofA\"), executed a First Amendment (the \"Amendment\") to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of November 30, 2015 (the \"Credit Agreement\"), among the Company as borrower, its subsidiaries as guarantors, and BofA. The primary changes effected by the Amendment were to increase the maximum amount available under, and extend the maturity date of, the revolving credit facility. The Amendment also increased the maximum total amount of investments in other craft brewers, other than the acquisition of all or substantially all the assets or a controlling ownership interest, from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000.As amended, the Credit Agreement provides for a credit facility which includes a $45,000,000 reducing revolving facility, including a $2,500,000 sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, as well as a term loan facility in the approximate amount of $8,900,000 as of the date of this report. The maximum amount of the revolving facility is subject to loan commitment reductions in the amount of $750,000 each quarter beginning March 31, 2020. The Company may use the proceeds of the credit facility for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures. The term of the credit facility expires on September 30, 2023.As amended, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to satisfy the following financial covenants: (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and (ii) a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.20 to 1.00. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants is an event of default and would give BofA the right to declare the entire outstanding loan balance immediately due and payable.Additional terms of the Credit Agreement are summarized in Note 9 to the Company's audited financial statements included in Item 8 of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.Item 2.01Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.The purchase by the Company of the intellectual property assets of Cisco Brewers, Inc.

The Company paid $23,000,000 in cash (the \"Purchase Price\"), assumed certain liabilities relating to the acquired assets, and agreed to pay an additional amount as a cash incentive payment based on Product shipments in 2023 in excess of a specified number of barrels.  The Purchase Transaction excluded certain assets owned by Cisco, including intellectual property rights associated with its operation of its brewpub in Nantucket and a taproom in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as the Company's brewpub in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which Cisco began operating in June 2018 pursuant to an arrangement with the Company.

Emerging growth company  If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.  Explanatory Note On October 1, 2018, Fortive Corporation (Fortive) announced that it had consummated its previously announced combination of Fortives Automation & Specialty platform (excluding Fortives Hengstler and Dynapar businesses) (the A&S Business) with Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (Altra) (such transaction, the Transaction). The Transaction included a split-off exchange offer (the Exchange Offer) of shares of Stevens Holding Company, Inc. (Newco) to Fortive stockholders, immediately followed by a merger of Newco with a wholly owned subsidiary of Altra, with Newco surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Altra (the Merger), and the transfers of certain non-U.S. assets, liabilities and entities of the A&S Business to certain subsidiaries of Altra (the Direct Sales).The Exchange Offer and the Merger were consummated on October 1, 2018, in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the Separation Agreement), dated as of March 7, 2018, by and among Fortive, Newco and Altra, and the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement), dated as of March 7, 2018, by and among Fortive, Newco, Altra and McHale Acquisition Corp. (Merger Sub).Item 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.On October 1, 2018, in connection with the consummation of the Exchange Offer and the Merger, and in accordance with the Separation Agreement and the Merger Agreement: Fortive, Newco and Altra entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (the Tax Matters Agreement), which will govern the parties respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to taxes, including taxes arising in the ordinary course of business, and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of shares of Newco common stock to Fortives stockholders and certain related transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment.  The Tax Matters Agreement also sets forth the respective obligations of the parties with respect to the filing of tax returns, the administration of tax contests, and assistance and cooperation on tax matters. Fortive and Altra (on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries including Newco) entered into an Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement (the IP License Agreement), pursuant to which Fortive has granted Newco a perpetual and irrevocable, non-exclusive license to certain retained patents, copyrights and trade secrets owned by Fortive and used by Newco, and Newco has granted Fortive a perpetual and irrevocable, non-exclusive license to certain patents, copyrights and trade secrets owned by Newco and used by Fortive. The IP License Agreement also provides for applicable requirements and restrictions regarding use and sublicensing of the licensed intellectual property.Fortive, Newco and Altra entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the Transition Services Agreement), pursuant to which Fortive and its affiliates will provide Newco and Newco and its affiliates will provide Fortive and its affiliates with specified support services and other assistance for a limited time following the closing of the Merger.The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Tax Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the IP License Agreement, copies of which were filed by Altra as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 to Altras Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 1, 2018, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 2.01Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.The Exchange Offer expired at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on September 26, 2018. Under the terms of the Exchange Offer, 35,000,000 shares of Newco common stock were exchanged for each share of Fortive common stock accepted in the Exchange Offer. Fortive accepted 15,824,931 shares of its common stock in exchange for the 35,000,000 shares of Newco common stock owned by Fortive after proration as described below. Because the Exchange Offer was oversubscribed, Fortive accepted tendered shares of its common stock on a pro rata basis in proportion to the total number of shares validly tendered and accepted for exchange. Stockholders who owned fewer than 100 shares of Fortive common stock, or an odd lot of such shares, and who validly tendered all of their shares, were not subject to proration in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer. The final proration factor of approximately 11.6114% was applied to all other shares of Fortive common stock that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn to determine the number of such shares that were accepted from each tendering stockholder. Based on the final count by the exchange agent, Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the final results of the Exchange Offer are as follows: Total number of shares of Fortive common stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn:128,334,418Odd-lot shares tendered that were not subject to proration:1,044,789Total number of shares of Fortive common stock accepted:15,824,931Immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Merger closed effective as of October 1, 2018. In the Merger, each share of Newco common stock outstanding immediately following the Exchange Offer (except for shares of Newco common stock held by Fortive, Newco, Altra or Merger Sub, which shares were canceled and ceased to exist, and no consideration was delivered in exchange therefor) was converted into one share of Altra common stock (with stockholders entitled to cash in lieu of fractional shares). As of the completion of the Merger, holders of Fortive common stock who participated in the Exchange Offer owned approximately 54% of Altras outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis. As part of the Transaction, Fortive has also completed the Direct Sales and received approximately $1.4 billion in cash proceeds and retirement of outstanding debt securities.As a result of the Transaction, Fortive reduced its common stock outstanding by 15,824,931 shares of its common stock.The information contained in Item 1.01 above is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the foregoing description of the Transaction is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement, copies of which were filed by Altra as Exhibits 2.1 and 10.1 to Altras Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 9, 2018, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.Item 9.01Financial Statements and Exhibits.(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

Securities Exchange Transaction with Natur Holdings, B.V  On November 13, 2018, Future Healthcare of America (the Company) completed the transactions (the Share Exchange Transaction) contemplated by that certain Share Exchange Agreement, among the Company and the former shareholders of Natur Holdings, B.V., a Netherlands-based holding company (Natur). In connection with the Share Exchange Transaction, the former shareholders of Natur received the equivalent of 215,759,999 shares of the Common Stock of the Company (the Common Stock), which was issued in part as 115,760,000 shares of Common Stock and in part as 100,000 shares of voting, convertible Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series B Preferred Stock) representing 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock upon conversion. The Series B Preferred Stock will convert automatically upon the Company increasing its the number of shares of Common Stock of authorized capital, which it plans to do promptly so as to cause the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. Immediately after the Share Exchange Transaction, the former Natur shareholders now collectively have a controlling position among the shareholders of the Company, and Natur has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  In connection with the Share Exchange Transaction, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) appointed Ms. Ellen Berkers as a director, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. For certain biographical and other information regarding the newly appointed officers and directors, see the disclosure under Item 5.02 of this report.  Business Overview  Natur Holding B.V. (formerly known as Naturalicious) is a young dynamic company, headquartered in the Netherlands, constantly refining and expanding its product offering and digital presence. The company was founded in late 2015.  Natur integrates new manufacturing technologies with standard practices to extend the shelf life of its products and yet remain Naturalicious (natural & delicious) to build out its value chain for theburgeoning market of 100% juices and healthy snacks. It has delivered its products in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and plans on expanding in Europe and ultimately the United States. Our understanding and application of the technological aspects of manufacturing assures a pathogen-free food and beverage experience that preserve the nutrients and enzymes to the maximum level possible, while retaining the raw fresh nature of the products. The result being the best tasting product with the maximum goodness and highest nutrient density -- something the consumer seeks more and more in our target markets.  Our commitment to deliver to the consumers the best products possible in the market is strengthened with the market experience of our business partner, that is also a significant shareholder through their wholly owned subsidiary, the AMC Group, which is one of the leading European suppliers of white label natural juices to over 70 of the largest retail chains in Europe. AMC is well known as the sectors innovation leader with proprietary manufacturing, software and production technologies.   The AMC proprietary technologies, which at the core of the proposition incorporate HPP (Cold High Pressure Processing) and SNFC (Super Non-From Concentrate), hold in the taste of freshness and yet extends shelf life to over 6 months. AMC was one of the companys founders that invested initially in AMC NT to lock in the strategic links between the businesses.  The clear differentiator of the company is the Natur brand supported by its disruptive marketing; consumers are interested in what we produce and how we voice this to the market rather than how it is made. From an investment perspective, this is a fundamental component of our business model as we are not having to commit very significant capex to building our own modern production and bottling facilities to deliver into the increasing demand for our product.   In the future we anticipate delivering documented nutrigenomic (functional) properties that we believe will be an aid to personal weight management, increase energy, lower cholesterol, counter sleep disorders and boost immunity response. We believe that these product aspects will uniquely position the Natur products at the top of the European market at a mid-market price point. This profile will be accessible internationally, as we have already undertaken preliminary discussions with distributors in major international markets outside Europe.   Our market profile will be further enhanced with the new Natur personalised snacking/juicing experience that will accelerate the trend towards snackification already present in more mature markets in the United States and Europe. To our portfolio of natural /organic snacks, we have developed a sophisticated App delivering social, functional and personalised engagement.    1       This all reflects the Natur brand characteristics, shaped by the management vision of becoming a leader in the hi-tech health food and beverage marketplace; achieved by responding to changing market needs and staying continuously ahead of emerging trends. Natur also intends to address the demand of the consumer for knowledge about what he/she consumes with a greater level of supply chain transparency. It is envisioned that both for the retailer and consumer Natur could ultimately achieve this using the so-called block chain/ledger technologies. For the retailer an extra insight for their customers and the possibility to build a Natur community with the ensuing loyalty and reward programs, we believe can be an additional value proposition for our products.  Corporate Management  The Company and Natur Holding has gathered a top team of experienced management in the field of food and beverage, who have an in-depth knowledge of the market arena for our products and yet have the right fit of discipline and entrepreneurial vision and drive.  The Natur Holding non-executive board has top industry relevant experience and has a hands-on drive to make the company successful and to gain a leadership position in the healthy product food and beverage market place through the offering of a palette of products that not only are natural and delicious but with functional beneficial properties and can also be supplied as organic. Their expertise and insights in the digital world will also help drive the Natur to embrace these new delivery frontiers.  From Farm to Fridge  The founders and management believe Natur will evolve to become one of the leaders in the European market and later in the United States farm to fridge market segment, supplying superior fruit and vegetable juices, smoothies, and natural and organic snacks. Natur is able to accommodate a great speed of market innovation and is able to meet market demands quickly; therefore Natur is well positioned to establish its market share and partner with the major international leaders to distribute our products.

These statements are based on managements current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements; the Registrant can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Registrants expectations include, but are not limited to, the risk that the Merger will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; the inability of the Registrant or GCEAR II to obtain the Stockholder Approval or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to completion of the Merger; risks related to disruption of managements attention from the ongoing business operations due to the Merger; availability of suitable investment opportunities; changes in interest rates; the availability and terms of financing; general economic conditions; market conditions; legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business of the Registrant or GCEAR II; and other factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Registrants most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as updated by the Registrants subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2018, June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018 filed with the SEC, and other reports filed by the Registrant with the SEC, copies of which are available on the SECs website, www.sec.gov.

Financial Statements and Exhibits(a) Financial Statements of Businesses AcquiredOn November 7, 2018, the SEC, pursuant to its authority under Rule 3-13 of Regulation S-X, granted the Registrant a waiver from the requirements under Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of Regulation S-X to file the audited financial statements of GRECO and related pro forma financial information related to the Self Administration Transaction. The Registrant submitted a request for such waiver because, among other things, GRECOs historical financial statements are not representative of the operations acquired by the Registrant and are not useful to investors given the significantly differing operations of GRECO from 2015 through 2017. In addition, it would be burdensome and expensive to prepare separate audited financial statements of GRECO because GRECO does not prepare separate financial statements; rather it is consolidated into GCCs financial statements. Further, even if provided, the audited financials do not provide relevant information of the operations of GRECO on a going forward basis and would be confusing to investors. Accordingly, such Item 9.01(a) and (b) financial information is omitted.(b)Pro FormaFinancial InformationSee above.

(Hines Global or the \"Company\"), through a wholly-owned subsidiary of its operating partnership, acquired from Fresh Park Venlo B.V. (the \"Seller\") the leasehold interest in Fresh Park Venlo, a specialized logistics park located in Venlo, the Netherlands.  The Seller is not affiliated with Hines Global or its affiliates.Fresh Park Venlo is comprised of 23 buildings constructed between 1960 and 2018, and consists of approximately 2,863,630 leasable square feet that is, in the aggregate, 95% leased to more than 60 tenants.The purchase price for Fresh Park Venlo was 117.5 million (approximately $136.3 million assuming a rate of $1.16 per EUR on the date of the transaction), exclusive of transaction costs and working capital reserves.  Hines Global funded the acquisition using proceeds from its public offering, an advance under its credit facility with Hines Interests Limited Partnership (Hines), an affiliate of Hines Global, and a secured mortgage from a third-party, which is described further in Item 2.03 below. The estimated going-in capitalization rate for Fresh Park Venlo is approximately 6.7%.  The estimated going-in capitalization rate is determined by dividing the projected property revenues in excess of expenses for the first fiscal year by the net purchase price (excluding closing costs and taxes).  Property revenues in excess of expenses includes all projected operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, parking and any other property-related income) less all projected operating expenses (property operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes, insurance and property management fees).  The projected property revenues in excess of expenses includes assumptions which may not be indicative of the actual future performance of the property, including the assumption that the currenttenants will perform under their lease agreements during the next 12 months and assumptions related to leasing vacant space.Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.On October 3, 2018, Hines Global, through a wholly-owned subsidiary of its operating partnership, entered into a facility agreement (the \"Facility\") with Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG (PBB), as borrower, and HGIT Fresh Park Venlo Holdings LLC and HGIT Fresh Park Partner LLC, as Guarantors, to fund the acquisition of Fresh Park Venlo.  The Facility is for the principal sum of approximately 75.0 million (approximately $87.0 million assuming a rate of $1.16 per EUR on the date of the transaction).  Interest accrued on the Facility is due and payable quarterly on the fifteenth day of February, May, August, and November in each year, with the first interest payment date being November 15, 2018.  The Facility has a floating interest rate of Euribor + 1.50% per annum.  Repayment of principal is due upon the maturity of the Facility on August 15, 2023.The Facility may be prepaid at any time, beginning ten business days after the date of the Facility, subject to certain prepayment fees and conditions, including but not limited to providing not less than 5 days advance written notice to PBB.The Facility contains various customary events of default, with corresponding grace periods, including, without limitation, payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults.  The Facility also contains customary financial and other covenants, including, without limitation, covenants regarding the debt yield, failure to maintain a property management agreement and other customary covenants which are more fully described therein.  Upon the occurrence of any default, PBB may declare all sums owed under the Facility immediately due and payable.Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.On October 9, 2018, Hines issued a press release relating to Hines Global's acquisition of Fresh Park Venlo.

Emerging growth company oIf an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.  oItem 2.01Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.On October 10, 2018, Hooper Holmes, Inc. (the Company) and each of its subsidiaries (collectively, Sellers) completed the disposition of substantially all of their assets (the Transaction) to Summit Health, Inc. (Buyer), a subsidiary of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of September 25, 2018 (the Purchase Agreement). The Purchase Agreement was approved on October 10, 2018 by order (the Sale Order) of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court) in the Companys proceeding under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in Case No. 18-23302 (RDD) (the Bankruptcy Proceeding).Upon closing of the Transaction, the Company received payment of the cash purchase price of $27.25 million from Buyer (the Sale Proceeds), an increase of $250,000 from the purchase price originally agreed upon under the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of August 27, 2018 by and among Sellers and Buyer (the Original Agreement), the material terms of which were described in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 27, 2018. The Purchase Agreement amended and restated the terms of the Original Agreement.The Company and Buyer are parties to a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which the Company will continue to provide certain transition services to Buyer through December 31, 2018, in exchange for Buyers payment of the Companys expenses in providing the services.In addition to approving the Transaction, the Sale Order adopted a distribution waterfall of the Sale Proceeds, which will govern the Companys use of the Sale Proceeds. Because the Sale Proceeds are insufficient to repay all of the Sellers secured and unsecured debt obligations after making provision for the payment of administrative expenses in the Bankruptcy Proceeding, the approved distribution waterfall does not provide for, and the Company does not expect, the payment of any amount to the Companys stockholders. Although the Company will remain in existence with shares of common stock outstanding while its affairs are wound down through the remainder of the Bankruptcy Proceeding, the Company cautions its stockholders that trading in shares of the Companys common stock during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Proceeding is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for shares of the Companys common stock may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, of which none is expected, by stockholders in the Bankruptcy Proceeding. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its common stock.The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the final, executed Purchase Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1. The Purchase Agreement has been attached as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide investors with information regarding its terms. The Purchase Agreement is not intended to provide any factual information about Sellers or Buyer.Information about the Bankruptcy Proceeding, including a copy of the Sale Order, is available online at https://dm.epiq11.com/#/case/PRH/info. Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.On October 10, 2018, Kevin Johnson tendered his resignation, effective October 25, 2018, as the Companys Chief Financial Officer.Item 8.01Other Events.On October 10, 2018, the Company and Buyer issued a press release announcing the closing of the Transaction. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsThis Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"intends,\" \"plan,\" and \"will\" or, in each case, their negative, and other variations or comparable terminology.

Any forward-looking statement made in this Form 8-K is not a guarantee of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements, as a result of various factors, including, without limitation the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of the companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as the same may be updated from time-to-time in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, would or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report primarily on our current expectations about future events and trends that we believe may affect our current and proposed business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those described under the caption Risk Factors of Item 1A of our 10-K Transition Report for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on or about June 29, 2018, and which is incorporated herein by reference and can be accessed by Hyperlink in Item 9.01 below (the 10-K Transition Report). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements used herein. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Current Report will prove to be accurate, and therefore prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this Current Report completely, and it should be read and considered with other reports or registration statements filed by us with the SEC. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future.  EXPLANATORY NOTES  Except as otherwise indicated by context, references to the Company, we, our, us and words of similar import refer to KonaTel, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly named Dala Petroleum Corp., which is the Registrant, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, KonaTel, Inc., a Nevada corporation (KonaTel Nevada).  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS  We have a limited public float of our outstanding common stock, and there has been no established trading market in our common stock during the past five years. See the caption Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of Part II, Item 5, of our 10-K Transition Report. These factors may result in uncertainty and volatility in the trading price of our common stock that may not have any relation to our current or future prospects. On or about September 29, 2017, our Application for continued quotations of our common stock on the OTC Markets Group OTCQB Tier (respectively, the OTC Markets and the OTCQB Tier) was not approved because of our limited public float and the high concentration of the ownership of our common stock in one entity at that time, among other potential reasons. With the December 18, 2017, closing of our KonaTel Nevada Merger (see the applicable 8-K Current Reports in Item 9.01 below that are incorporated herein by reference and that can be accessed by Hyperlink), the percentage of a majority of the ownership of our common stock in a limited number of holders increased, with an aggregate of 33,749,000 shares (includes 1,224,000 shares underlying vested options that could have been exercised within 60 days of the date of this Current Report) being deemed to be beneficially owned by D. Sean McEwen, our Chairman, CEO, President and a director, 13,500,000 shares of direct ownership and 749,000 shares underlying personally owned vested options, and 12,225,000 shares (includes 250,000 shares underlying vested options owned by others) of indirect ownership under a Shareholder Voting Agreement executed and delivered at the Effective Time of the KonaTel Nevada Merger, or December 14, 2017. This Shareholder Voting Agreement has a two (2) year term, ending December 17, 2019. Based upon the present number of our outstanding shares of our common stock of 41,916,286 shares (which includes the referenced shares underlying vested options that can be exercised within 60 days of the date of this Current Report, along with an additional 7,000,000 shares issued under the Apeiron Merger Agreement (as defined below), effective December 31, 2018, and which also included a two (2) year Shareholder Voting Agreement (as defined below), Mr. McEwen is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 80.5% of our outstanding shares. See the caption Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management of Part   2     III, Item 12 of our 10-K Transition Report referenced in Item 9.01 for additional information on how these computations were computed its filing date or June 29, 2018. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets OTC Pink Tier (the OTC Pink Tier) under the trading symbol KTEL.  The information contained in this Current Report responds to the following items of Form 8-K:          Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.     Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.     Item 3.02  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.     Item 9.01  Financial Statements and Exhibits.  Section 1  Registrants Business and Operations.  Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  Apeiron Merger Agreement.  Dated and effective as of December 31, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Apeiron Merger Agreement) between us (KonaTel, Inc., a Delaware corporation [KonaTel, or we, our or us and words of similar import]), and KonaTel Acquisition Corp., a Nevada corporation and our recently formed wholly-owned acquisition subsidiary (Merger Subsidiary); and Apeiron Systems, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Apeiron), and Joshua Ploude (Ploude) and Vyacheslav Yanson (Yanson), jointly and severally (hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the Apeiron Shareholders). We exchanged 7,000,000 shares of our $0.001 mill par value common stock comprised of restricted securities as defined in SEC Rule 144 for all of the outstanding securities of Apeiron, and on the Effective Date and time of the merger (December 31, 2018 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Standard Time), Apeiron became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger). The Merger is intended to qualify as a reverse triangular merger under Sections 368(a)(1) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. In connection with the Closing of the Merger, and as of the Effective Date of the Merger, we: entered into (i) Employment Agreements with each of the Apeiron Shareholders; and (ii) Lock-Up/Leak-Out Agreements, which govern the resale of the KonaTel Shares each received in the Merger. Additionally, a Shareholder Voting Agreement with a two (2) year term between us, D. Sean McEwen, our President and Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Apeiron Shareholders, was executed and delivered by these parties as a condition of the Closing (see the heading Shareholder Voting Agreement below). All officers and directors of Apeiron resigned on the Effective Date, with the exception that Ploude remained as the President of Apeiron (see his Employment Agreement described below), and D. Sean McEwen was designated and elected as the sole director and Chairman and as the Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer of Apeiron.  In addition to the share exchange and the referenced agreements above, the Apeiron Merger Agreement also required that there be a Net Working Capital computation that will provide sufficient cash resources to operate Apeiron for a period of not less than ninety (90) days, with the understanding that at the end of such ninety (90) period, the parties will review and re-compute the New Working Capital computation, with the understanding that any overage of the estimate shall be paid to the Apeiron Shareholders and any deficit shall be paid by the Apeiron Shareholders to us. The Apeiron Merger Agreement also contained customary representations and warranties, closing conditions of the Parties and closing deliveries, among other terms and conditions.   The Apeiron Shareholders also have a $1.00 Guaranteed Value of the KonaTel Shares they received under the Apeiron Merger Agreement, which indicates, subject to certain enumerated conditions, that in the event that the KonaTel common stock does not reach an average closing price equal to or exceeding $1.00 per share (the Guaranteed Value) over any period of ten (10) consecutive Trading Days (the Calculated Value) during the period commencing on December 31, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2021 (the Valuation Period) as quoted by the applicable Trading Market on which the KonaTel Shares are listed or quoted for trading, KonaTel shall issue to the Apeiron Shareholders for each such share of the KonaTel Shares continuously owned and held of record in the respective names of the Apeiron Shareholders (the Qualifying Shares) during the Valuation Period the number of shares of KonaTel common stock that is equal to the number of Qualifying Shares multiplied by the difference between the Guaranteed Value and the highest Calculated Value achieved during the Valuation Period (the Guarantee Shares) such that: [Guarantee Shares = Qualifying Shares x (Guaranteed Value  highest Calculated Value]).

Introductory NoteThis Current Report on Form8-K is being filed in connection with the closing on November30, 2018 of the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 6, 2018, as amended on September 18, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (Pebblebrook), Pebblebrook Hotel, L.P. (Pebblebrook OP), Ping Merger Sub, LLC (Merger Sub), Ping Merger OP, LP (Merger OP), LaSalle Hotel Properties (LaSalle) and LaSalle Hotel Operating Partnership, L.P. (LaSalle OP).Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at 5:01 p.m., Eastern Time, on November30, 2018 (the Partnership Merger Effective Time), Merger OP merged with and into LaSalle OP (the Partnership Merger) with LaSalle OP continuing as the surviving partnership, and, at 5:02 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 30, 2018 (the Company Merger Effective Time), LaSalle merged with and into Merger Sub (the Company Merger and, together with the Partnership Merger, the Mergers), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company. As a result of the Mergers, LaSalle OP became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pebblebrook OP and Merger Sub became the successor by merger to LaSalle. Effective as of December 3, 2018, Merger Sub assigned all its rights and obligations to Pebblebrook Hotel Trust and was dissolved. On November 30, 2018, Ping Merger OP GP, LLC, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Pebblebrook OP, was admitted as the general partner of LaSalle OP.Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.On November30, 2018, in connection with the completion of the Mergers, LaSalle repaid in full all indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations under, and terminated, the Second Amended and Restated Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated as of January 10, 2017 (the Credit Agreement), with Citibank, N.A. (Citi), as Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and the other lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement provided for a senior unsecured credit facility of up to $750 million, with a sublimit of $100 million for letters of credit, and an unsecured term loan of $300 million.In addition, on November 30, 2018, LaSalle repaid in full all indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations under, and terminated, the Amended and Restated Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement, dated as of January 10, 2017 (the Term Loan Agreement), with Citi, as Administrative Agent (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), and the other lenders named therein. The Term Loan Agreement provided for an unsecured term loan of $555 million.Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Company Merger (the Company Merger Effective Time), each common share of beneficial interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (each, a LaSalle Common Share), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, was converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, either: (i) 0.92 (the Exchange Ratio) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Share Consideration), $0.01 par value per share, of Pebblebrook (the Pebblebrook Common Shares) and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any; or (ii) $37.80 in cash, subject to certain adjustments and to any applicable withholding tax (the Cash Consideration and, together with the Common Share Consideration, the Merger Consideration). The maximum number of LaSalle Common Shares that were eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration was equal to 30% of the aggregate number of LaSalle Common Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook were excluded from the cash election in the Company Merger, effectively increasing the maximum number of LaSalle Common Shares that were eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration to approximately 33% of the aggregate number of LaSalle Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. The holders of 85.8 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 77% of LaSalle Common Shares deemed outstanding for purposes of the election (including the shares held by Pebblebrook, which were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration), elected to receive the Cash Consideration. Holders of the remaining 25.4 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 23% of the LaSalle Common Shares eligible to elect the Cash Consideration, either elected to receive Pebblebrook Common Shares, did not submit valid elections, submitted an election expressing no preference or represent the approximately 10 million LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook that were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration. The LaSalle Common Shares of shareholders that validly elected to receive 100% Cash Consideration were converted into an amount in cash equal to $37.80 multiplied by (i) the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by (ii) the Cash Consideration percentage of approximately 38.9%, and an amount of Pebblebrook Common Shares equal to approximately 61.1% of the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by 0.92. The cash elections of LaSalle shareholders that validly elected a combination of the Cash Consideration and Common Share Consideration were prorated based on the above percentages subject to their individual cash/share elections.In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Company Merger Effective Time, each outstanding 6.375% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (the LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares) was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred shares of Pebblebrook, the 6.375% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the Series E Preferred Shares), having the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers materially unchanged from those of the LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares, and each outstanding 6.3% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (the LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares) was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred shares of Pebblebrook, the 6.3% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the Series F Preferred Shares), having the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers materially unchanged from those of the LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares.At the effective time of the Partnership Merger (the Partnership Merger Effective Time), each common unit of LaSalle OP (a LaSalle OP Common Unit) that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, other than LaSalle OP Common Units held by LaSalle and its subsidiaries, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 0.92 newly and validly issued common units of Pebblebrook OP, without interest.In addition, each restricted LaSalle Common Share (the Restricted Shares) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, including those held by LaSalle executive officers, automatically became fully vested and all restrictions thereon lapsed, and was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each award of performance shares with respect to LaSalle Common Shares (each, a Performance Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time automatically became earned and vested with respect to 180% of the target number of LaSalle Common Shares subject to such Performance Award agreement, and thereafter was cancelled and exchanged for, the right to receive such number of earned and vested LaSalle Common Shares, which were considered outstanding as of such time, and to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such LaSalle Common Shares. Each award of deferred LaSalle Common Shares (each, a Deferred Share Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time was cancelled in exchange for the number of LaSalle Common Shares subject to such Deferred Share Award (prior to its cancellation), which LaSalle Common Shares were considered outstanding as of such time, and to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such LaSalle Common Shares.Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Ruleor Standard; Transfer of Listing.On November30, 2018, in connection with the completion of the Mergers, LaSalle notified the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), that, effective as of the Company Merger Effective Time, each LaSalle Common Share, LaSalle Series I Preferred Share and LaSalle Series J Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time would be automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, one Series I Preferred Share and one Series J Preferred Share, respectively, and the NYSE has filed a notification of removal from listing on Form25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to effect the delisting from the NYSE and deregistration under Section12(b)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), of the LaSalle Common Shares, LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares and LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.(a)  Acquisition of OnstreamOn December 13, 2018, Mistras Group, Inc. (\"Mistras,\" the \"Company\", \"we or us) acquired Onstream Holdings, Inc. (\"OnStream\"), the 100% parent company of Onstream Pipeline Inspection Services, Inc., a provider of pipeline integrity inspection services with facilities in Calgary, Canada and Houston, Texas, primarily serving the oil and gas market.   The acquisition was effected pursuant to (i) a Share Purchase Agreement (\"the Agreement\"), dated December 13, 2018, among 2159562 Alberta Ltd., as purchaser, Mistras, 100% parent company of the purchaser, Onstream, and the shareholders of Onstream listed on Schedule A to the Agreement, who collectively owned approximately 95% of the shares of Onstream and (ii) separate share purchase agreements with other minority shareholders who collectively owned the remaining 5% of the shares of Onstream.Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mistras purchased all the outstanding shares of Onstream for approximately $189.9 million (CAD), or approximately $143.2 million U.S. Dollars (USD), subject to a post-closing adjustment to the extent Onstream's working capital on the closing date is different than an agreed upon amount.  The Agreement contains representations, warranties, obligations and conditions customary for agreements governing transactions of a similar nature.  In connection with the Agreement, Chad Niehaus and Gerry Wilkinson, two of the major shareholders who will continue to manage the Onstream business for Mistras, entered into agreements whereby they agreed for two years not to compete against Onstream and not to solicit Onstream employees, customers and suppliers.  The other major shareholder, Novacap and affiliates, a Canadian private equity firm, also agreed to a 2-year non-solicitation restriction and a 2-year restriction on acquiring or investing in agreed upon competitors of Onstream. Approximately $2.3 million CAD (approximately $1.7 million USD) is being held in escrow for various time periods to secure payment of indemnification claims and other items.  The Company also obtained a representation and warranty insurance policy for $19 million CAD (approximately $14.3 million USD) to cover losses incurred by Onstream for breaches of representations and warranties by the shareholders.  Onstream's operating subsidiary entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Niehaus and Wilkinson and certain other members of its senior management as part of the acquisition.   The foregoing is a summary of the Agreement and not a complete description of its terms and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.The purchase of Onstream was financed by borrowings under the Companys credit facility.(b)  $400 Million Credit AgreementOn December 13, 2018, the Company entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement)  with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for the lenders and a lender, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Keybank National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and TD Bank, National Association, as lenders.  The Credit Agreement provides the Company with a $300 million revolving line of credit and a $100 million senior secured term loan A facility, both with a maturity date of December 12, 2023.  The Credit Agreement permits us to borrow up to $100 million in non-US dollar currencies and to use up to $20 million of the credit limit for the issuance of letters of credit.  The Credit Agreement is secured by liens on substantially all our assets and is guaranteed by some of our subsidiaries. Under certain circumstances, the revolving line of credit can be increased to $450 million with the consent of the lenders.Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate, at our option, plus, as applicable a LIBOR margin ranging from 1% to 2%, or a base rate margin ranging from -1.25% to -.375%, based upon our Funded Debt Leverage Ratio.  Funded Debt Leverage Ratio is generally the ratio of (1) all outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money and other interest-bearing indebtedness as of the date of determination to (2) EBITDA.  The Credit Agreement defines EBITDA as (a) net income, minus (b) income (or plus loss) from discontinued operations minus (c) extraordinary gains (or plus extraordinary losses), plus (d) income tax expenses, plus (e) interest expense, plus (f) depreciation, depletion, and amortization (including non-cash loss on retirement of assets), plus (g) stock compensation expense, minus (h) cash expense related to stock compensation, plus (i) certain amounts of EBITDA of acquired business for the prior twelve months, plus (j) certain expenses related to the closing of the Credit Agreement, plus (k) non-cash expenses which do not (in the current or any future period) represent a cash item (excluding non-cash gains which increase net income), plus (l) non-recurring charges (not to exceed $10 million in the four consecutive quarters immediately preceding the date of determination) for items such as severance, lease termination charges, asset write-offs and litigation settlements paid, and multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, all determined for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the date of determination of EBITDA.  We have the benefit of the lowest margin if our Funded Debt Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 1.0 to 1, and the margin increases as the ratio increases, to the maximum margin if the ratio is greater than 3.25 to 1.  The Company will also bear additional costs for market disruption, regulatory changes effecting the lenders funding costs, and default pricing of an additional 2% interest rate margin if the Company is in default under the Credit Agreement.The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain a Funded Debt Leverage Ratio not exceeding 4.25- to-1 through December 31, 2018, reducing to a maximum permitted ratio of 3.50-to-1 as of March 31, 2020 and all quarterly periods thereafter, and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1.25-to-1.  Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio means the ratio, as of any date of determination, of (a) (i) EBITDA for the 12 month period immediately preceding the date of determination, taken together as one accounting period, less (ii) the aggregate amount of all capital expenditures made during the period, less (iii) taxes paid in cash during the period, less (iv) Restricted Payments paid in cash during the period, -to- (b) the sum of (i) all interest, premium payments, debt discount, fees, charges and related expenses of us and our subsidiaries in connection with borrowed money (including capitalized interest) or in connection with the deferred purchase price of assets, in each case, to the extent treated as interest in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and to the extent paid in cash during the period, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of all redemptions or similar acquisitions for value of outstanding debt for borrowed money or regularly scheduled principal payments made during the period, but excluding any such payments to the extent refinanced through the incurrence of additional Indebtedness otherwise expressly permitted under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) payments made during the period under all leases that have been or should be, in accordance with GAAP as in effect for our 2017 audited financial statement, recorded as capitalized leases.  Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company can elect to increase the maximum permitted Funded Debt Leverage Ratio to 4.0-to-1 for four fiscal quarters immediately following the fiscal quarter in which the Company acquires another business, with the maximum permitted ratio reducing back to the 3.5-to-1 in the fifth fiscal quarter following such acquisition.  The Company can make this election twice during the term of the Credit Agreement.The Credit Agreement limits our ability to, among other things, create liens, make investments, incur more indebtedness, merge or consolidate, make dispositions of property, pay dividends, make distributions to stockholders or repurchase our stock, enter into a new line of business, enter into transactions with affiliates and enter into burdensome agreements.  The Credit Agreement does not limit our ability to acquire other businesses or companies except that the acquired business or company must be in our line of business, we must be in compliance with the financial covenants on a pro forma basis after taking into account the acquisition, and, if the acquired business is a separate subsidiary, in certain circumstances the lenders will receive the benefit of a guaranty of the subsidiary and liens on its assets and/or a pledge of its stock.The foregoing is a summary of the Credit Agreement and not a complete description of its terms and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.Item 2.01.

The cash purchase price was funded with cash on hand and approximately $750 million drawn under the existing revolving credit facility of NextEra Energy US Partners Holdings, LLC, which was subsequently repaid using the proceeds of the Class B investment described below.On December 21, 2018, NEP issued and sold 100% of the non-controlling Class B interest in NEP Renewables for approximately $750 million (the Class B investment) under the membership interest purchase agreement dated August 31, 2018 (membership purchase agreement), filed as Exhibit 2.3 to the Purchase Agreement Form 8-K, between NEP, NEP Renewables Holdings, LLC (NEP Renewables Holdings) and NEP Renewables with Western Renewable Partners LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of a fund managed by BlackRock Global Energy & Power Infrastructure (BlackRock). The Class B investment represents an approximately 59% investment in NEP Renewables, subject to the specified conditions set forth in the membership purchase agreement and working capital adjustments. NEP Renewables Holdings will retain 100% of the Class A interest, representing an approximately 41% investment in NEP Renewables, and NEP will consolidate NEP Renewables. In connection with the Class B investment, the limited liability company agreement for NEP Renewables was amended and restated (the LLC agreement). Under the LLC agreement, NEP, through its indirect ownership of NEP Renewables Holdings, will receive 85% of NEP Renewables cash distributions for the first three years after funding, and BlackRock will receive 15%, which implies a yield to BlackRock of approximately 2.5% per annum for the first three years. After three years, NEP will receive 20% of NEP Renewables cash distributions and BlackRock will receive 80%. From the third to the fourth anniversary after funding, NEP has the option (the buyout right), subject to certain limitations and extensions, to purchase 100% of BlackRocks interest in NEP Renewables at a buyout price that implies a 7.75% pre-tax return to BlackRock (inclusive of all prior distributions). If the buyout right is exercised, NEP has the right to pay at least 70% of the buyout price in NEP non-voting common units, issued at the then-current market price of NEP common units, with the balance paid in cash, subject to limitations as described in the LLC agreement. Under a registration rights agreement entered into on December 21, 2018, BlackRock has certain rights, beginning January 1, 2025, to require NEP, under certain circumstances, to initiate underwritten offerings for the units that are issuable if NEP exercises the buyout right. On December 21, 2018, the partnership agreement of NEP was amended and restated (NEP Partnership Agreement) to establish the terms of the rights of the NEP non-voting common units. Following any exercise of the buyout right, the NEP non-voting common units will have, among other terms, the right to receive pro rata quarterly cash distributions and the right to convert, subject to certain limitations, the NEP non-voting common units into NEP common units on a one-for-one basis. On the same date, the partnership agreement of NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo) was also amended and restated to establish the equivalent terms of the rights of NEP OpCo non-voting common units.Set forth below are responses to the applicable Items of Form 8-K that are implicated by the transaction described above.SECTION 1 - REGISTRANTS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSItem 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive AgreementThe information set forth in the Explanatory Note of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 and qualified in its entirety by the text of the relevant agreements, which are included as Exhibits 3.1, 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATIONItem 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of AssetsThe information set forth in the Explanatory Note of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01.

EXPLANATORY NOTEThis Current Report on Form8-Kis being filed in connection with the completion on October 22, 2018 of the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated as of August 20, 2018, by and between NorthStar/RXR New York Metro Real Estate, Inc. (the Company), CNI NS/RXR Advisors, LLC, the Companys advisor (the Advisor), CNI NS/RXR Advisors Merger Subsidiary, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Advisor (the Merger Sub), and Colony Capital Investment Holdco, LLC, an affiliate of the Advisor. As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company disposed of all of its assets in a series of transactions (collectively, the Asset Monetization).  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following the completion of the Asset Monetization, the Company merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving the merger (the Merger, and together with the Asset Monetization, the Transaction) at the Merger Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on October 22, 2018 (the Closing Date).  The events described below took place in connection with the completion of the Transaction.Item1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.The information set forth in the Explanatory Note and Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. The information set forth in the Explanatory Note of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. On October 17, 2018, the Company, through a subsidiary of its operating partnership, completed the disposition of its approximately 1% interest in a 1.8 million square foot Class-A office building located at 1285 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan to an unaffiliated third party, for gross proceeds of approximately $5.39 million (the 1285 AoA Sale).On October 18, 2018, the Company, through a subsidiary of its operating partnership, completed the disposition of its $19.0 million interest in a $20.0 million mezzanine loan secured by a pledge of an ownership interest in a luxury condominium development project located in the West Village of New York City to CLNC ML Jane NYC, LLC, an affiliate of a company managed by Colony Capital, Inc., the Companys co-sponsor for gross proceeds of approximately $19.0 million (the Jane Street Sale).The repayment by the borrower in August 2018 of a mezzanine loan in which the Company owned a $9.5 million interest and the consummation of the 1285 AoA Sale and the Jane Street Sale, completed the components of the Asset Monetization and resulted in the Company having no assets other than cash. The net proceeds to the Company from the Asset Monetization were approximately $33.7 million. Following the completion of the Asset Monetization, the Company completed the Merger.  Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the shares held by affiliates of the Companys co-sponsors, Colony Capital, Inc. and RXR Realty LLC, which own 212,139 and 70,713 shares in the Company respectively, were voluntarily forfeited in exchange for their par value of $0.01 per share (the Sponsor Share Forfeiture).At the Merger Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of the Companys common stock (Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, after giving effect to the Sponsor Share Forfeiture, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $9.1877 (the Per Share Merger Consideration).  The Per Share Merger Consideration reflects each share of Common Stocks pro rata share of the net proceeds from the Asset Monetization, plus all available cash held by the Company, less all known liabilities of the Company incurred prior to the Closing Date and all incurred and unpaid expenses related to the Transaction. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Appendix A to the definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 11, 2018 and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3.03. Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders. The information set forth in the Explanatory Note and Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the Merger, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to Merger Effective Time was converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. At the Merger Effective Time, each of the Companys stockholders ceased to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, other than the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. Item 5.01. Changes in Control of the Registrant. The information set forth in the Explanatory Note, Item 2.01 and Item 3.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference. At the Merger Effective Time, as contemplated under the Merger Agreement, the Company merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity.  As of the consummation of the Merger, the Merger Sub was wholly owned by the Companys Advisor.Item 8.01. Other Events. In addition to the Per Share Merger Consideration of $9.1877, the Companys stockholders have received regular operating distributions from the time of their initial investment.  In addition, certain of the Companys stockholders received special stock distributions of 0.05 shares and 0.10 shares, respectively, of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held of record on December 31, 2016 and May 16, 2017, respectively. Accordingly, the aggregate amount of distributions that the Companys stockholders have received since the time of their initial investment, including regular operating distributions and Per Share Merger Consideration received in respect of shares issued in the special stock distributions, varies depending on when they made their initial investment and whether they participated in the Companys distribution reinvestment plan.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.On November 30, 2018, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (Pebblebrook) completed its previously announced merger with LaSalle Hotel Properties (LaSalle) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September 6, 2018, as amended on September 18, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among Pebblebrook, Pebblebrook Hotel, L.P. (Pebblebrook OP), Ping Merger Sub, LLC (Merger Sub), Ping Merger OP, LP (Merger OP), LaSalle and LaSalle Hotel Operating Partnership, L.P. (LaSalle OP). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on November 30, 2018, Merger OP merged with and into LaSalle OP (the Partnership Merger) with LaSalle OP surviving as a subsidiary of Pebblebrook OP. Immediately following the Partnership Merger, LaSalle merged with and into Merger Sub (the Company Merger and, together with the Partnership Merger, the Mergers) with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pebblebrook. On December 3, 2018, Merger Sub assigned all of its rights and obligations to Pebblebrook and was dissolved.Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Company Merger (the Company Merger Effective Time), each common share of beneficial interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (each, a LaSalle Common Share), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, was converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, either: (i) 0.92 (the Exchange Ratio) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Share Consideration), $0.01 par value per share, of Pebblebrook (the Pebblebrook Common Shares) and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any; or (ii) $37.80 in cash, subject to certain adjustments and to any applicable withholding tax (the Cash Consideration and, together with the Common Share Consideration, the Merger Consideration). The maximum number of LaSalle Common Shares that were eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration was equal to 30% of the aggregate number of LaSalle Common Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook were excluded from the cash election in the Company Merger, effectively increasing the maximum number of LaSalle Common Shares that were eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration to approximately 33% of the aggregate number of LaSalle Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time.  The holders of 85.8 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 77% of LaSalle Common Shares deemed outstanding for purposes of the election (including the shares held by Pebblebrook, which were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration), elected to receive the Cash Consideration. Holders of the remaining 25.4 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 23% of the LaSalle Common Shares eligible to elect the Cash Consideration, either elected to receive Pebblebrook Common Shares, did not submit valid elections, submitted an election expressing no preference or represent the approximately 10 million LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook that were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration. The LaSalle Common Shares of shareholders that validly elected to receive 100% Cash Consideration were converted into an amount in cash equal to $37.80 multiplied by (i) the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by (ii) the Cash Consideration percentage of approximately 38.9%, and an amount of Pebblebrook Common Shares equal to approximately 61.1% of the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by 0.92. The cash elections of LaSalle shareholders that validly elected a combination of the Cash Consideration and Common Share Consideration were prorated based on the above percentages subject to their individual cash/share elections.In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Company Merger Effective Time, each outstanding 6.375% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (the LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares) was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred shares of Pebblebrook, the 6.375% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the Series E Preferred Shares), having the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers materially unchanged from those of the LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares, and each outstanding 6.3% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (the LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares) was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred shares of Pebblebrook, the 6.3% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the Series F Preferred Shares), having the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers materially unchanged from those of the LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares.At the effective time of the Partnership Merger (the Partnership Merger Effective Time), each common unit of LaSalle OP (a LaSalle OP Common Unit) that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, other than LaSalle OP Common Units held by LaSalle and its subsidiaries, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 0.92 newly and validly issued common units of Pebblebrook OP, without interest. In addition, each restricted LaSalle Common Share (the Restricted Shares) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, including those held by LaSalle executive officers, automatically became fully vested and all restrictions thereon lapsed, and was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each award of performance shares with respect to LaSalle Common Shares (each, a Performance Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time automatically became earned and vested with respect to 180% of the target number of LaSalle Common Shares subject to such Performance Award agreement, and thereafter was cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of earned and vested LaSalle Common Shares, which were considered outstanding as of such time, and to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such LaSalle Common Shares. Each award of deferred LaSalle Common Shares (each, a Deferred Share Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time was cancelled in exchange for the number of LaSalle Common Shares subject to such Deferred Share Award (prior to its cancellation), which LaSalle Common Shares were considered outstanding as of such time, and to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such LaSalle Common Shares.Item2.03.

On the Effective Date, Foothills Bancorp merged with and into SmartFinancial (the Merger), with SmartFinancial continuing as the surviving corporation. Immediately following the Merger, Foothills Bank & Trust merged with and into SmartBank, a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of SmartFinancial, with SmartBank continuing as the surviving banking corporation. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Foothills Bancorp common stock, par value $1.00 per share, was converted into and cancelled in exchange for the right to receive $1.75 in cash, without interest, plus 0.666 shares of SmartFinancial common stock, par value $1.00 per share. SmartFinancial expects to issue approximately 1,183,292 shares of SmartFinancial common stock and pay approximately $3.11 million, in cash, in respect of shares of Foothills Bancorp common stock as consideration for the Merger. SmartFinancial will not issue fractional shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger, but will instead pay cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the volume weighted average closing price of SmartFinancial common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 10 consecutive trading days ending on and including October 30, 2018 (calculated as $22.46). Additionally, at the effective time of the Merger, each unexercised option to purchase Foothills Bancorp common stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a single, lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) $17.50 minus the per share exercise price of the option multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Foothills Bancorp common stock subject to the option. SmartFinancial expects the aggregate consideration payable to holders of unexercised options to purchase Foothills Bancorp common stock to be approximately $2.96 million.

Immediately after the Mergers, (i) there were approximately 51,161,022 shares of SYNNEX Stock outstanding and (ii) the former Convergys shareholders owned approximately 22% of the outstanding SYNNEX Stock. The issuance of the shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the Mergers was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on a Registration Statement on Form S-4, as amended (Reg. No. 333-226708), which was declared effective on August 28, 2018. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form8-Kfiled by SYNNEX on July 2, 2018, and is incorporated herein by reference.Item 2.03Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.As previously disclosed, on August 9, 2018, SYNNEX entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain United States subsidiaries of SYNNEX, as guarantors, which provides for the extension of term loans to SYNNEX in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.8 billion, subject to certain conditions including the completion of the Mergers. 2On October 5, 2018 (the Initial Funding Date), in connection with the completion of the Mergers described above, the conditions to the lenders obligation to fund the initial term loan under the Credit Agreement were satisfied, and SYNNEX borrowed an aggregate amount of $1.45 billion under the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of the initial term loan were used to finance the cash portion of the consideration payable in connection with the Mergers, to repay certain indebtedness of Convergys, the payment of related fees and expenses, with any remaining balance available to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, SYNNEX may borrow up to five additional term loans during an availability period over the ninety day period following the Initial Funding Date in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. The proceeds of any such additional term loans will be used to repurchase or settle outstanding convertible debentures of Convergys tendered in connection with the Mergers until all such tendered convertible debentures have been repurchased or settled, and thereafter, may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.The maturity of the Credit Agreement is five years after the Initial Funding Date. The outstanding principal amount of the term loans advanced under the Credit Agreement is payable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.25% commencing on the last day of the second full fiscal quarter after the Initial Funding Date, based upon the outstanding principal amount of the loans calculated as of the end of the availability period, with the unpaid balance due in full on the maturity date.Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, in the case of LIBOR rate loans, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate, plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which may range from 1.25% to 1.75%, based on SYNNEX Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Loans borrowed under the Credit Agreement that are not LIBOR rate loans bear interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) the greatest of (A) 1/2 of 1.0% plus the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day and (y) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (B) the LIBOR rate plus 1.0% per annum, and (C) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the U.S. plus (ii) the Applicable Rate, which may range from 0.25% to 0.75%, based on SYNNEX Consolidated Leverage Ratio.The Credit Agreement contains various loan covenants that restrict the ability of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries to take certain actions, including, incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, mergers or consolidations, dispositions of assets, repurchase or redemption of capital stock, making certain investments, entering into certain transactions with affiliates or changing the nature of their business. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants which require SYNNEX to maintain at the end of any of its fiscal quarters commencing with the first fiscal quarter ending after entry into the Credit Agreement, (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio not to exceed (A) prior to the closing date of the Mergers, 4.0:1.0, (B) from and after the first fiscal quarter of SYNNEX ending after the closing date of the Mergers through and including the fifth full fiscal quarter of SYNNEX ending after the closing date of the Mergers, 4.25:1.0 and (C) from and after the sixth full fiscal quarter of SYNNEX ending after the closing date of the Mergers, 4.0:1.0 and (ii) a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) equal to or greater than 3.50:1.0. The Credit Agreement also contains various customary events of default, including with respect to change of control of SYNNEX.SYNNEX obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of its and certain of its Domestic Subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) assets and are guaranteed by certain of its Domestic Subsidiaries, and the interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreement are secured on a pari passu basis with the interests of the lenders under SYNNEXs existing U.S. senior secured credit agreement dated as of November 27, 2013 (as amended), by and among SYNNEX, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as agent, pursuant to an intercreditor agreement.The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Form8-Kfiled by SYNNEX on August 10, 2018, and is incorporated herein by reference.3Item 8.01  Other Events On October 5, 2018, Concentrix Corporation, a division of SYNNEX, issued a press release announcing the closing of the acquisition of Convergys.

Explanatory Note  As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 5, 2018, by Viking Energy Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Company), the Company entered into an agreement to acquire oil and gas leases and related assets in Texas and Louisiana, and the agreement was subsequently amended as previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 2, 2018. This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to disclose various matters in connection with the completion of the acquisition transaction.   Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   On September 2, 2018, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement) with Bodel Holdings, L.L.C., Cleveland Holdings, L.L.C., Delbo Holdings, L.L.C., DeQuincy Holdings, L.L.C., Gulf Coast Working Partners, L.L.C., Oakley Holdings, L.L.C., SamJam Energy, L.L.C., and Perry Point Holdings, L.L.C., all Texas limited liability companies (collectively the Sellers), pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase from the Sellers (the Acquisition) all of the Seller's right, title, interest and estate, real or personal, recorded or unrecorded, movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, in and to certain oil and gas leases in Texas and Louisiana (collectively the Purchased Assets).  As of November 1, 2018, the Company and the Sellers entered into the First Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement (the First Amendment) to modify the Agreement to (i) extend the closing (Closing) deadline to the earlier date (the Closing Date) of (a) 10 days from the date on which the Sellers obtain consents from applicable landowners authorizing the transfer to the Company of the oil and gas leases representing 80% of the total PDP (PV10) value of the Purchased Assets, or (b) December 31, 2018; (ii) provide for a portion of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets in respect of which post-closing consent to transfer is required from the State of Louisiana or the State of Texas, to be paid into escrow at closing to provide the Sellers up to 180 days thereafter to secure the requisite post-closing governmental agency approvals (the State Lease Escrow Component); (iii) upon the Sellers obtaining third-party consents to assign a portion of the oil and gas leases representing at least 80% of the PDP (PV10) value of the Purchased Assets, require the parties to close, on the Closing Date, on the purchase of those assets (provided that no single purchased asset represents more than 15% of the total PDP (PV10) value of the assets purchased at the closing); (iv) provide the Sellers from the date of the first closing until March 21, 2019, to obtain any remaining third-party consents required to transfer any of the Purchased Assets not otherwise transferred to the Company on the first closing (the Deferred Closing Component); and (v) to make other changes described in the First Amendment.  As of December 21, 2018, the Company and the Sellers entered into the Second Amendment to Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Second Amendment) to modify the Agreement to (i) confirm that the purchase price (the Purchase Price) payable by the Company for the Purchased Assets shall be equal to A minus B, where (a) A equals the present value, using a discount rate of 18% (i.e. PV18), of the Proved Developed Producing (PDP) Reserves with respect to the Purchased Assets as determined by an independent engineering firm in its reserve report issued jointly to the Company and the Sellers, or the Sellers agent, dated on or about August 1, 2018, but (1) excluding certain wells referenced therein, and (2) including a particular well recently recompleted by the Sellers if the engineering firm allocates PDP value to such well, but on the basis of the reserve values in the engineering report being adjusted to reflect the NYMEX strip commodity pricing reported as of 12:00 noon (CT) the day prior to the Closing Date and (b) B equals five million dollars ($5,000,000) (ii) to confirm the Purchase Price shall be payable to Sellers (a) in part by wire transfer in immediately available funds from the proceeds available to the Company under the senior secured term loan made available to an indirect subsidiary of the Company at Closing after deducting all direct fees and transaction costs related to the Acquisition and obtaining financing therefor (the Cash Payment), of which the amount to be deposited into escrow shall be paid directly to the escrow agent and the remaining amount shall be paid directly to Sellers (b) in part by Sellers retaining a portion of the post-effective date net revenues (the Net Revenue Payment), which sum shall equal (1) the post-effective revenue due Company less the post-effective expenses paid by Sellers (both as reflected on the Preliminary Settlement Statement in connection with Closing), less (2) the sum required by Ichor Energy, LLC (Ichor Energy), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the initial interest payment due to its senior secured lender and (c) in part by the execution and delivery of a Secured Promissory Note by the Company in favor of the Sellers (the Seller Note) on the following terms: (1) Maturity Date  earlier of (x) January 31, 2020 or (y) the date on which the Company completes a transaction with one or more of the Sellers for a purchase price greater than $50,000,000 (2) Interest Rate  10% per annum, payable at maturity (with the Sellers to waive interest if the Seller Note is paid in full within 150 days after Closing) (3) Security  a pledge of the membership interests of Ichor Energy Holdings, LLC (Ichor Holdings), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement (the Security Agreement) and (4) Principal Amount  the principal amount of the Seller Note shall be equal to the Purchase Price less the Cash Payment and the Net Revenue Payment and (iii) to make other changes described in the Second Amendment. The foregoing description of the Second Amendment is qualified by reference to the full text of the Second Amendment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.3 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.      2       As of December 26, 2018, the Company and the Sellers entered into the Collateral Agreement to Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Collateral Agreement), pursuant to which the Company and the Sellers agreed to include in and exclude from the Acquisition certain of the Purchased Assets, with a corresponding adjustment to the Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) for the Purchased Assets. The foregoing description of the Collateral Agreement is qualified by reference to the full text of the Collateral Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.4 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.  The Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the Collateral Agreement, is referred to herein as the Acquisition Agreement.  The Acquisition closed on December 28, 2018, and in connection therewith: (i) Ichor Energy (LA), LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ichor Energy, acquired all of the Purchased Assets located in Louisiana; and (ii) Ichor Energy (TX), LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ichor Energy, acquired all of the Purchased Assets located in Texas. The PV18 of the PDP of the Purchased Assets as determined by the engineering firm in accordance with the Second Amendment, and solely for the purpose of assisting the parties with determining a component of the formula to calculate the pre-adjusted Purchase Price and without certifying or opining on the value of the Purchased Assets as at the closing or the day prior thereto, was $91,008,600.00, resulting in a base price of $86,008,600. The Purchase Price was subsequently adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement. The following is a graphic representation of the organizational structure of the Company and its subsidiaries involved in the Acquisition:        3       To facilitate the Acquisition, the Company, among other things: (i) executed the Seller Note and the security and pledge agreement contemplated in the Seller Note and (ii) caused Ichor Holdings and Ichor Holdings wholly-owned subsidiary, Ichor Energy (the Borrower), to enter into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Loan Agreement) dated on or about December 28, 2018, with ABC Funding LLC, as administrative agent (the Agent) for various lenders (collectively, the Lenders).  The Loan Agreement provides for a total loan amount of $63,592,000 (the Term Loan) of which $58,172,202 was funded on closing of the Acquisition, with $5,412,798 being available to the Borrower on or before March 31, 2019, under a delayed draw facility subject to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement. The Borrower also paid an upfront fee equal to 2.25% of the Term Loan amount. The maturity date of the Term Loan is the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the Maturity Date). The principal amount advanced under the Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) a floating rate of interest equal to 10.00% plus LIBOR, and (ii) a fixed rate of interest equal to 12.00%. If there is an event of default, the interest rate under the Term Loan increases by an additional 2.0% per annum. Interest is payable in cash monthly on the last day of each calendar month, commencing January 31, 2019. Principal payments are due on the Term Loan as follows: the Borrower shall repay, beginning on the last business day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019, and on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter (in each case, if not a business day, the immediately preceding business day), an amount equal to 1.25% of the principal amount of the loans made under the Loan Agreement. To the extent not previously paid, all loans under the Loan Agreement shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.   The Loan Agreement contains various affirmative covenants that require the Borrower to, among other things, maintain adequate records; provide the Agent with financial statements, reserve reports, and other financial information; provide notice of certain events; hedge production volumes; reimburse the Agent and Lenders for certain expenses in connection with the Loan Agreement; maintain insurance and provide the Agent with access to meetings of the Borrowers governing body or the governing body of their managers. The Loan Agreement contains various negative covenants that limit the ability of the Borrower to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness; grant certain liens; engage in certain asset acquisitions and dispositions; make certain loans; make or declare certain dividends or distributions; issue additional equity interests; engage in certain changes in their organizational structure; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make certain capital expenditures; amend their organizational documents or form or acquire additional subsidiaries.      4       The Loan Agreement also contains covenants that require the maintenance of specified financial ratios or conditions as follows:           Asset Coverage Ratio: Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2019, no loan party shall permit the Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined below) to be less than 1.35:1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter commencing as of the closing of any fiscal month on or after May 31, 2018. The Asset Coverage Ratio means, as of any date of determination, the ratio of (a) the sum of (i) PDP PV-10 (as reflected in the most recent Reserve Report delivered either August 15 (as of June 30) or February 15 (as of December 31) of each year, as the case may be (giving pro forma effect to material acquisitions or dispositions since the date of such reports)), (ii) the amount of unrestricted cash held in deposit accounts subject to control agreements, and (iii) the net mark to market value (which may be a negative value) of the Borrower and its subsidiaries swap agreements, to (b) the sum of the aggregate amount of (i) indebtedness of the Borrower and any loan party secured by a lien on any property or asset owned or held by the Borrower or a loan party.              Minimum Liquidity: Beginning on March 31, 2019, Borrower shall at all times maintain in the deposit accounts, subject to control agreements in favor of the Agent, a minimum cash balance equal to at least $2,000,000.  The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and events of default. Events of default include, among other things, payment defaults; breaches of representations and warranties; covenant defaults; the attachment of levies and garnishments; certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency; certain final and non-appealable judgments; actual or asserted failure of any security document supporting the Loan Agreement; payment of subordinated indebtedness and a change of control. If such an event of default occurs, the Lenders would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.  Obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by mortgages on the oil and gas leases of the subsidiaries of the Borrower, a security agreement covering all assets of the Borrower, and a pledge by Ichor Holdings of all of the membership interests in the Borrower.   The foregoing descriptions of the Loan Agreement, Seller Note and Security Agreement are qualified by reference to the full text of the Loan Agreement, Seller Note and Security Agreement which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.  Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.  The disclosure in Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01.

The PV18 of the PDP of the Purchased Assets as determined by the engineering firm in accordance with the Second Amendment, and solely for the purpose of assisting the parties with determining a component of the formula to calculate the pre-adjusted Purchase Price and without certifying or opining on the value of the Purchased Assets as at the closing or the day prior thereto, was $91,008,600.00, resulting in a base price of $86,008,600. The Purchase Price was subsequently adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement. The adjusted Purchase Price was $84,336,863.99, of which: (i) $10,504,091.33 was paid into escrow on account of the State Lease Escrow Component; (ii) $5,412,798.46 was deferred on account of the Deferred Closing Component; and (iii) $68,419,974.20 was due on the initial closing (the Initial Closing Amount). The Initial Closing Amount was satisfied via previous payments by the Company, a $40,811,712.51 cash payment to the Sellers from proceeds under the Term Loan, and by execution and delivery by the Company of the Seller Note in the principal amount of $23,777,948.01. The purchase price is subject to further post-closing adjustments.        5       Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.  The descriptions of the Loan Agreement, Term Loan and the borrowings thereunder set forth in Item 1.01 above are incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

In consideration of the Lenders extending the Term Loan to the Borrower, on or about December 28, 2018, (i) the Borrower issued the Lenders warrants (the Borrower Warrants) to purchase up to 50,000 common units of Borrower at an exercise price equal to $0.01 per Borrower warrant unit, and (ii) the Company issued the Lenders warrants (the Company Warrants) to purchase up to 9,165,690 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price equal to the twenty (20)-day volume- weighted average price of the common stock of the Company, based on the 10-day period prior to and the 10-day period following the issuance date. The issuances of the Borrower Warrants and Company Warrants to the Lenders were made in reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder, as there was no general solicitation, the Lenders were accredited investors, and the issuances did not involve a public offering.

The Purchase Price is subject to adjustment (up or down) based on the results of the agreed audit of Gear4's actual net sales, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2018.  In the event Gear4s actual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 are equal to or exceed the estimated net sales for such period, STRAX will be entitled to receive 5,000,000 EUR of the Consideration Shares (the Adjustment Holdback Shares) from the Company and a cash payment from Patriot in US dollars equal to the amount by which such actual net sales exceeds the estimated net sales.  If, however, Gear4s actual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 are less than the estimated net sales for such period, such shortfall shall be remedied, at STRAXs election, by either (i) STRAX making a cash payment to Patriot in the full amount of the shortfall, or (ii) the Companys obligation to issue the Adjustment Holdback Shares being reduced by the full amount of the shortfall; provided that in the event the shortfall exceeds the value of the Adjustment Holdback Shares (calculated as of the Acquisition Date), STRAX will also be required to promptly pay to Patriot in US dollars the remaining amount of such shortfall.  Under the Purchase Agreement, STRAX is also entitled to additional consideration (the Additional Consideration) from Buyer if during the 2019 financial period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2019 (the Financial Period), the audited Gear4 net sales, as reported under U.S. GAAP, exceeds certain targets. Specifically, if Gear4 has audited net sales of at least $60,000,000 USD but less than $90,000,000 USD in the Financial Period, STRAX is entitled to a total $5,000,000 USD of Additional Consideration, and if Gear4 has audited net sales of at least $90,000,000 USD in the Financial Period, STRAX is entitled to a total $10,000,000 USD of Additional Consideration. Such Additional Consideration is required to be paid to STRAX no later than thirty (30) days from the later of (i) the filing of the Company's audited 2019 financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and (ii) in the event of any objection to the Companys calculation of such Additional Consideration, final determination of the amount of such Additional Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants and indemnification provisions whereby STRAX has agreed to indemnify, subject to certain limitations, Patriot and its affiliates (including Gear4 after closing) for certain losses, liabilities and damages. 2,000,000 EUR of the Consideration Shares and the Indemnification Holdback Cash will be retained by the Company or Patriot (as applicable) for eighteen (18) months following the Acquisition Date as security for STRAXs indemnification obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
