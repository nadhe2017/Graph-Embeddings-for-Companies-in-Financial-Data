"COLUMBIA/HCA HEALTHCARE CORPORATION": "Hospital Corporation of America was founded in 1968 in Nashville by Dr. Thomas Frist Jr., his father, Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., and Jack Massey. Initially, it was just one hospital and a nursing home. But by the end of the next year, the company operated more than two dozen hospitals and was growing rapidly. Fast-forward to the late 1980s and early '90s. The company was taken private, spun off more than 100 hospitals and then went public again. In 1994, it completed its fateful merger with Columbia Healthcare Corp, Fort Worth, Texas. The merged company, called Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., operated 192 hospitals. Tension soon developed between Frist Jr. and Richard Scott, the aggressive young corporate lawyer who had founded Columbia and was the new company's chairman and CEO. In 1997, the federal government's probe of Columbia/HCA's billing practices became public through a series of raids by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service. Following the raids, the Columbia/HCA board of directors forced Scott to resign. At this point the company had grown to nearly 350 hospitals. The government investigation led to Medicare fraud indictments against the company and ultimately a $1.74 billion settlement."

"EAST DUBUQUE NITROGEN PARTNERS LP": "We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in July 2011 by Rentech, a 
publicly traded provider of clean energy solutions and nitrogen fertilizer, to 
own, operate and grow our nitrogen fertilizer business. Our nitrogen fertilizer
facility, which is located in East Dubuque, Illinois, has been in
operation 
since 1965, with infrequent unplanned shutdowns. We produce primarily anhydrous
ammonia, or ammonia, and urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN, at our 
facility, using natural gas as our primary feedstock. Substantially all of our 
products are nitrogen-based. 


Our facility is located in the center of the Mid Corn Belt, the largest market 
in the United States for direct application of nitrogen fertilizer products. 
The Mid Corn Belt includes the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, 
Nebraska and Ohio. The States of Illinois and Iowa have been the top two corn 
producing states in the United States for the last 20 years according to the 
National Corn Growers Association. We consider our market to be comprised of 
the States of Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. Based on information provided by 
Blue, Johnson & Associates, Inc., or Blue Johnson, for the 12 months ended June
30, 2010, the amount of ammonia consumed as fertilizer in the States of 
Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin was approximately 4.0 times the amount produced 
for sale in those states, and the amount of UAN consumed was approximately 1.4 
times the amount produced for sale in those states. 


Our core market consists of the area located within an estimated 200-mile 
radius of our facility. In most instances, our customers purchase our nitrogen 
products at our facility and then arrange and pay to transport them to their 
final destinations by truck. To the extent our products are picked up at our 
facility, we do not incur shipping costs, in contrast to nitrogen fertilizer 
producers located outside of our core market that must incur transportation and
storage costs to transport their products to, and sell their products in, our 
core market. In addition, we do not maintain a fleet of trucks and, unlike 
some of our major competitors, we do not maintain a fleet of rail cars because 
our customers generally are located close to our facility and prefer to be 
responsible for transportation. Having no need to maintain a fleet of trucks 
or rail cars lowers our fixed costs. The combination of our proximity to our 
customers and our storage capacity at our facility also allows for better 
timing of the pick-up and application of our products, as nitrogen fertilizer 
product shipments from more distant locations have a greater risk of missing 
the short periods of favorable weather conditions during which the application 
of nitrogen fertilizer may occur. As a result of these factors, during each of 
the last three fiscal years, we realized higher average net sales prices per 
ton of ammonia than our publicly traded nitrogen fertilizer competitors that 
have reported this information. Ammonia sales price data for privately held 
ammonia producers is unavailable. According to Blue Johnson, as of February 
28, 2011, we and our publicly traded nitrogen fertilizer competitors comprised 
approximately 66% of the aggregate ammonia production capacity in the United 
States, including ammonia produced by publicly traded and privately held 
companies for agricultural and industrial uses or upgraded to other nitrogen 
products. Also, based on data from the USDA and Blue Johnson, for the 12 months
ended June 30, 2009, we and our publicly traded nitrogen fertilizer competitors
accounted for approximately 32% of the aggregate sales of nitrogen products in 
the United States by international and domestic producers (measured in tons of 
nitrogen).
  
Our facility can produce up to 830 tons of ammonia per day, with the capacity 
to upgrade up to 450 tons of ammonia to produce up to 1,100 tons of UAN per 
day. During the nine months ended June 30, 2011 and the fiscal year ended 
September 30, 2010, we produced approximately 218,000 tons and 267,000 tons, 
respectively, of ammonia, and approximately 245,000 tons and 287,000 tons, 
respectively, of UAN. For the nine months ended June 30, 2011 and the fiscal 
year ended September 30, 2010, ammonia and UAN combined accounted for 
approximately 91% and 89%, respectively, of our total gross profit. Our 
facility has the flexibility to vary our product mix significantly, which 
permits us to upgrade our ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, 
nitric acid and liquid and granular urea each season, depending on market 
demand, pricing and storage availability. 


During the nine months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we generated revenues of 
approximately $141.3 million and $96.3 million, respectively, net income of 
approximately $21.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA
of approximately $67.0 million and $21.7 million, respectively. During the 
fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we generated revenues of 
approximately $131.4 million, $186.4 million and $216.6 million, respectively, 
net income of approximately $5.0 million, $28.2 million and $30.1 million, 
respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $31.0 million, $63.7 million
and $60.4 million, respectively. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012,
subject to certain assumptions, we expect our net income and Adjusted EBITDA to
be $88.6 million and $100.6 million, respectively.

V-Go is indicated for continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin over 24 hours at preset rates and on-demand bolus dosing in two-unit increments in adult patients requiring insulin. V-Go is a small, discreet and easy-to-use disposable insulin delivery device that a patient adheres to his or her skin every 24 hours. V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the body’s normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery throughout the day and to manage their diabetes with insulin without the need to plan a daily routine around multiple daily injections.V-Go enables patients to closely mimic the body’s normal physiologic pattern of insulin delivery by using one type of insulin (fast-acting) at a continuous preset (background) basal rate over a 24-hour period and provides on-demand bolus dosing for meals and snacks. In numerous real-world analyses V-Go has consistently shown to lower A1C’s with less insulin. The discreet and convenient basal-bolus insulin delivery method provided by V-Go empowers patients to simplify their insulin management thereby mitigating the need to plan their daily routine around multiple daily injections. V-Go is cleared for use in the United States and the E.U. is commercially available in the United States."

"*Association for MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY V MYRIAD GENETICS INC": "Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., 569 U.S. 576 (2013), was a case challenging the validity of gene patents in the United States, specifically challenging certain claims in issued patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics that cover isolated DNA sequences, methods to diagnose propensity to cancer by looking for mutated DNA sequences, and methods to identify drugs using isolated DNA sequences. Prior to the case, the U.S. Patent Office accepted patents on isolated DNA sequences as a composition of matter. Diagnostic claims were already under question through the In re Bilski and Mayo v. Prometheus cases. Drug screening claims were not seriously questioned prior to this case. The case was originally heard in Southern District Court of New York. Proponents of the validity of these patents argued that recognizing such patents would encourage investment in biotechnology and promote innovation in genetic research by not keeping technology shrouded in secrecy. Opponents argued that these patents would stifle innovation by preventing others from conducting cancer research, would limit options for cancer patients in seeking genetic testing, and that the patents are not valid because they relate to genetic information that is not inventive, but is rather produced by nature. The District Court ruled that none of the challenged claims were patent eligible. Myriad then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit reversed the district court in part and affirmed in part, ruling that isolated DNA that does not exist alone in nature can be patented and that the drug screening claims were valid but that Myriad's diagnostic claims were unpatentable. On appeal, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case for the Federal Circuit to reconsider the issues in light of Prometheus. On remand, the Federal Circuit held that Prometheus did not affect the outcome of the case, so the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation filed a petition for certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and unanimously invalidated Myriad's claims to isolated genes. The Supreme Court held that merely isolating genes that are found in nature does not make them patentable."
