Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On June 29, 2018, Energy Resources 12 Operating Company, LLC (Buyer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Bruin E&P Non-Op Holdings, LLC (Seller), for the potential purchase (Acquisition No. 2) of Sellers interest in certain non-operated oil and gas properties and the related rights. On August 31, 2018, the Buyer closed on Acquisition No. 2, resulting in an approximate average 2.7% non-operated working interest in approximately 240 existing producing wells, 20 wells in various stages of drilling and completion, and additional future development locations, predominantly in McKenzie, Dunn, McLean and Mountrail counties of North Dakota (collectively, the Bakken Assets). With the closing of this acquisition, the Partnership owns an approximate average 5.4% non-operated working interest in the Bakken Assets. The original acquisition in the Bakken Assets from Seller closed on February 1, 2018 (Acquisition No. 1).
The Bakken Assets are operated by 14 third-party operators on behalf of the Partnership and other working interest owners. The Bakken Assets are located in the Bakken Shale formation, including the Antelope, Spotted Horn, Squaw Creek and Reunion Bay fields. The Bakken Shale and its close geologic cousin, the Three Forks Shale, are found in the Williston Basin, centered in North Dakota and are two of the largest oil fields in the U.S. While oil has been produced in North Dakota from the Williston Basin since the 1950s, it is only since 2007 through the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies that the Bakken has seen an increase in production activities.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price for Acquisition No. 2 was $82.5 million, subject to customary adjustments, and was funded by net proceeds of the Partnership's best-efforts offering and proceeds from the Partnership's $60.0 million revolving credit facility entered into August 31, 2018 (see description of the revolving credit facility in Item 2.03 below). In addition to the $82.5 million initial purchase price of Acquisition No. 2, the Partnership anticipates that it may be obligated to invest an additional $110 to $120 million in drilling capital expenditures through 2023 to retain its approximate 5.4% working interest in the Bakken Assets without becoming subject to non-consent penalties under the joint operating agreements governing the Bakken Assets.
The description of the Purchase Agreement set forth above is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Partnerships current report on Form 8-K filed on July 6, 2018.
Combined Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses for the Bakken Assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the six months ended June 30, 2018, along with the Partnerships pro forma financial statements reflecting Acquisition No. 1 and Acquisition No. 2 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the six months ending June 30, 2018, are included as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this current report on Form 8-K.
