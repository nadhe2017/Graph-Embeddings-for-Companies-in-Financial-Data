Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On July 9, 2018 RL Port Angeles, LLC completed the sale of the Red Lion Hotel Port Angeles in Port Angeles, Washington to BGP PA, LLC, an Oregon limited liability company (the Purchaser). The purchase price for the hotel was $19.5 million, which was paid in cash at closing.
At closing, an affiliate of the Purchaser entered into a franchise agreement with Red Lion Hotels Franchising, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Lion Hotels Corporation, to continue to operate the hotel under the Red Lion brand. The franchise agreement provides for a 10 year term and the payment of monthly royalty and program fees equal to a percentage of the hotels gross room revenue. Early termination of the franchise agreement by Red Lion Franchising upon default of the franchisee, or termination of the agreement by the franchisee without cause, will require the franchisee to pay a termination fee.
RL Port Angeles, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of RL Venture, LLC. RL Venture, LLC is a variable interest entity in which Red Lion Hotels Corporation holds a 55% interest, and therefore the registrant consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations of this entity.
