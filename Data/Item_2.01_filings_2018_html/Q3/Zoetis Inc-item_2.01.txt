Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
As described in the Introductory Note, on the Closing Date, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Abaxis.
At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock, no par value, of Abaxis (the Abaxis Common Stock) (other than shares, if any, held by Abaxis, the Company, Merger Sub or any of their subsidiaries and shares with respect to which dissenters rights were properly demanded in accordance with the Corporations Code of the State of California) was converted into the right to receive $83.00 in cash, without interest, per share (the Merger Consideration).
Additionally, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, certain Abaxis time- and performance-based restricted stock unit awards vested automatically upon the occurrence of the Effective Time in accordance with their existing terms and were cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Abaxis Common Stock underlying such awards. All other Abaxis time- and performance-based restricted stock unit awards were cancelled and automatically converted at the Effective Time into time-vesting restricted stock unit awards with respect to shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the Company Common Stock), with the number of underlying shares adjusted to reflect an exchange ratio based on the closing prices of shares of Company Common Stock and Abaxis Common Stock for the ten full trading days before the closing of the Merger, and on substantially the same terms and conditions (including the time-based vesting schedule) as were applicable to such Abaxis restricted stock unit awards immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that any performance goals underlying such Abaxis performance-based restricted stock unit awards were deemed satisfied as of the Effective Time.
Upon the closing of the Merger, the shares of Abaxis Common Stock, which previously traded under the ticker symbol ABAX on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the NASDAQ), have ceased trading on, and were delisted from, the NASDAQ.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 2.1.
