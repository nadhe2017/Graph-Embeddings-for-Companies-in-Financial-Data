Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On July 31, 2018, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into Nationstar, with Nationstar continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of WMIH following the Merger.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Nationstar common stock, par value $0.01 per share (each, a Share), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Nationstar, WMIH or Merger Sub or by any Nationstar stockholder who properly exercises and perfects appraisal of his, her or its Shares under Delaware law) was converted into the right to receive, subject to automatic proration and adjustment, either (i) if the holder of such Share made a valid cash election, $18.00 in cash (the consideration described in this clause (i), the Cash Election Consideration), or (ii) if the holder of such Share made a valid stock election (or failed to make a valid election), 12.7793 shares of common stock of WMIH, par value $0.00001 per share (the consideration described in this clause (ii), the Stock Election Consideration and, together with the Cash Election Consideration, the Merger Consideration). Based on the preliminary election results previously announced by Nationstar and WMIH on July 27, 2018, the Cash Election Consideration will be subject to automatic proration and adjustment, as described in the Merger Agreement and in the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus dated May 31, 2018, filed by WMIH with the SEC on June 1, 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time, to ensure that the total amount of cash paid (excluding cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) equals exactly $1,225,885,248.00. The Stock Election Consideration will not be prorated. After the final merger consideration election results are determined, the final allocation and proration of Merger Consideration will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
