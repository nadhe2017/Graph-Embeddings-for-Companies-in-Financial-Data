Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On August 31, 2018, CNL Healthcare Properties II, Inc. (referred to herein as we, us, our or the Company) through CHP II Partners, LP, our operating partnership, and its subsidiaries, completed the acquisition of a Class-A seniors housing community located in Riverview, Florida (Riverview) from The Crossings At Riverview, LLC and SSL Riverview, LLC (the Sellers) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24,250,000, excluding closing costs. We are not affiliated with the Sellers. Riverview has 92 units (62 assisted living and 30 memory care units) and was constructed in 2015. We funded the purchase of Riverview with proceeds from our public offering and proceeds from a loan agreement with Florida Community Bank, N.A. (FCB), which is described further in Item 2.03 below.
Following the closing of the acquisition, Riverview has engaged an independent third-party manager, Foster Development, Inc. (Foster Senior Living), to operate and manage Riverview pursuant to a five-year management agreement, which may be terminated without penalty under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the management agreement, Foster Senior Living will receive a base management fee of 5% based on the gross revenues collected each month with respect to Riverview. Based on certain performance thresholds set forth in the management agreement, Foster Senior Living may also receive an incentive management fee or have the base management fee subordinated.
An investment services fee of approximately $0.5 million, which is equal to 2.25% of the purchase price of Riverview was paid to our advisor, CHP II Advisors, LLC, in connection with the acquisition of Riverview.
