Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On September 12, 2018, Vegalab, Inc. (the Company) took possession of the Property and irrevocably closed, in escrow, the acquisition of the Property from Wallace Real Estate, LLC; Ottie J. Wallace, Trustee of the Wallace Bypass Trust under the Ottie Joel and Elizabeth Wallace Family Trust, and Elbulinick Properties, LLC. Because the office of the Secretary of State of California had not yet finished processing the formation of the Companys new wholly owned subsidiary, Tuttle Cross Dock, Inc., the title company was unable to record the title documents. All of the consideration and documents necessary for closing were delivered, all prorations were made, and interest on the promissory notes began as of, September 12, 2018,
The Tuttle Cross Dock property consists of approximately 27.33 acres of land located at or near the intersection of State Highway 140 and North Arboleda Dr. in the city of Merced, County of Merced, State of California. The property is zoned for commercial and industrial uses. Located on approximately seven acres of the property are an 18,750 square foot transit warehouse, and a railway cross dock facility. The remaining acreage is currently leased to agricultural growers and is intended to be put to other uses by the Company in the future.
The purchase price of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($2,500,000.00), was paid $500,000 by the issuance of One Hundred Fifty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty-Nine (157,729) restricted shares of the Companys Common Stock (the Shares) valued at Three Dollars and Seventeen Cents ($3.17) per share, and the balance of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) by the execution of two One Million Dollar ($1,000,000) promissory notes with monthly payments of interest only at eight percent (8%) per anum, and a balloon payment on the fifth (5th) anniversary of closing.
The foregoing summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by copies of the Assignment of Interest, the Purchase and Sale Agreement, and the Securities Exchange Agreement pursuant to which the Companys transfer agent is instructed to issue the Shares to the Sellers, all of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 respectively.
