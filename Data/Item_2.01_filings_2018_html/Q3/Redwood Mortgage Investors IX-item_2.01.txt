Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On June 27, 2018 Redwood Mortgage Investors IX, LLC (we or our) closed on the sale of loans comprising approximately 20% of our loan portfolio (the loans) to an unaffiliated bank (the Acquiror) pursuant to an Asset Sale Agreement dated June 27, 2018 (the Asset Sale Agreement). The Asset Sale Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The loans represented principal of $14,065,638 and interest owing of $82,027. The mortgage servicing rights were released to the Acquiror. The loans sold are secured by property located in the California counties of San Mateo, Sacramento, Contra Costa, San Bernardino, Alameda, Orange, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma, and San Joaquin. The transaction is the first of a planned ongoing program of loan sales to be undertaken, and was arranged by a third party unaffiliated national firm engaged by our manager, Redwood Mortgage Corp. The transaction generated an immaterial gain net of expenses in our June results.
We disclosed in our prospectus that we would engage in loan sales only when the dollar amount of pending loan applications meeting our investment criteria exceeded the capital available to lend. When we began negotiating the sale of the loans, we believed pending loan applications meeting our investment criteria would exceed the capital available to lend at closing based on loan application activity when we began negotiations with the Acquiror. Further, on the date of the sale of the loans, pending loan applications meeting our investment criteria exceeded capital available to lend. As this transaction occurred near the quarter end, we believe the loans to be funded in the place of the sold Loans will be funded in the third quarter of 2018 from applications then in the loan pipeline.
