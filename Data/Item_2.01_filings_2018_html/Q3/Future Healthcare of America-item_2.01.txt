Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Effective as of August 31, 2018, Future Healthcare of America, a Wyoming corporation (the Company), has terminated its operations in Casper, Wyoming. The primary assets involved in these operations were its list of clients and its Medicare license. The Company will transfer its clients to other providers and will voluntarily terminate its license.
The Company has determined to dispose of its Casper assets due to a lack of business in that location. In addition, as disclosed in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 18, 2018, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 21, 2018, the non-binding letter of intent that the Company signed with Natur Holding B.V., a Netherlands-based holding company (Natur), contemplates that the Companys current businesses will be disposed of either prior to or after the closing of the proposed definitive agreement between the parties, and the disposition of the Companys Wyoming assets will help to meet this condition. The Company is continuing to negotiate the terms of a binding agreement for the acquisition of Natur. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in this regard or that, if such an agreement is executed and closed, any such acquisition will be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders.
The Company will continue to employ one person to provide managed care services in Casper through the end of September, 2018, and one additional person to handle collection of invoices. In addition, the Company will continue its operations in Billings, Montana, from which it derived approximately 55 percent of its revenues in the six month period ended June 30, 2018, and it is expected that any definitive agreement for the acquisition of Natur will also provide for the Company to engage one director/consultant to assist with transition matters for an approximate period of up to three months
