On July 23, 2018, Ozop Surgical Corp., ("we," "us," "our," or the Company), through its wholly owned subsidiary, OZOP (Guangdong) Medical Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly owned foreign enterprise in China, acquired a 100% ownership interest in Yijingtong (Beijing) Technology Development Ltd (Yijingtong) from its shareholders who are unrelated parties pursuant to the terms of an Equity Transfer Agreement dated July 23, 2018 (the Equity Transfer Agreement). Yijington is a China based distributor of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) products to the orthopedic and neurosurgical markets in China.
Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Transfer Agreement, we agreed to pay the sellers of the Yijingtong equity interest RMB 1,000,000 (approximately US$147,815) payable in cash within 120 days of closing, in addition to inventory valued at RMB 4,072,719 (approximately US$ 602,009), which the parties will separately agree to payment and delivery terms. The sellers of Yijingtong will begin the registration change process upon execution of the Equity Transfer Agreement. In the event either party breaches the agreement, the non-breaching party shall have the right to request termination of the agreement and claim compensation from the breaching party for all economic losses.
The foregoing description of the Equity Transfer Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Equity Transfer Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
