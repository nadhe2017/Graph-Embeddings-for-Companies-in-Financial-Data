In addition, to supplement the indemnification provided by the Consideration Stockholders for breaches of Wazees representations and warranties, the Company obtained a representation and warranty insurance policy (the R&W Insurance Policy). The costs and expenses associated with obtaining the R&W Insurance Policy were shared equally by the Company and the Consideration Stockholders.

The shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the Wazee Merger were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
