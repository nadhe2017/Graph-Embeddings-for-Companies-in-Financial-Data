These forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the development, production, gathering and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. These risks include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, inflation, lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services, environmental risks, drilling and other operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital, the timing of development expenditures and the other risks described under Risk Factors below. Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Current Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Current Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

Our Company We are an independent oil and natural gas company with a primary focus on the development of our assets throughout the Merge, SCOOP and STACK plays of the Anadarko Basin. The Anadarko Basin, which spans from south-central Oklahoma to the northeast corner of the Texas panhandle, is one of the largest and most prolific onshore producing oil and natural gas basins in the United States. Our assets consist of over 150,000 net acres in the Merge, SCOOP and STACK plays within the Anadarko Basin. We focus our development on formations where we believe we can apply our technical and operational expertise in order to increase proved reserves and production to deliver compelling economic rates of return on a risk adjusted basis. Our primary developmental focus is on our Merge acreage position in Canadian, Grady and McClain counties in Central Oklahoma, where we have over 115,000 net acres. Our acreage position is concentrated in the oil and liquids-rich fairways of the Merge play, and provides us development opportunities through multiple stacked development horizons. We believe these development horizons have been substantially de-risked through industry development of approximately 300 horizontal wells. Our acreage position throughout the Merge is largely held by production, has a high average working interest and is predominantly contiguous, providing us with a high degree of operational control and development flexibility. The vast majority of our acreage in the SCOOP play is prospective for the Woodford and Springer shales, which are generally characterized by long-lived reserves and have had high drilling success rates. Our acreage in the STACK play has been delineated by numerous industry wells, which have been demonstrated to be economically productive through various formations. As of June 30, 2018, we had six rigs operating across our acreage position and we added two additional rigs in the third quarter of 2018. Our rigs are focused on drilling long lateral horizontal wells primarily in the Merge play. As of June 30, 2018, we operated 556 gross wells and had an interest in an additional 590 gross wells throughout our area of operations. 11

Our Properties The map below depicts the location of our properties as of June 30, 2018. We refer to gross and net acreage where we are designated as operator or expect to be designated as operator based on the size of our working interest relative to other working interest owners as our operated acreage or acreage we operated in this Current Report. As of June 30, 2018, we operated approximately 76% of our net acreage and had an average working interest of approximately 74% in all of our operated acreage. From January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018, we drilled or participated in 91 gross horizontal wells on production. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 80% of our total net acreage was held by production. This positions us to control the pace of our development efforts, strategically develop our acreage with a near-term focus on high-return projects, limit expenditures on lease renewals and limit the risk of losing high quality acreage through expiration of leases. Additionally, we closely monitor activity of other industry participants and adjust our future development plans based on information and what we believe to be best practices learned from our peers. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, our average net daily production was 36.9 MBoe/d (approximately 29% oil, 45% natural gas and 26% NGLs). During 2017, our average net daily production was 16.2 MBoe/d (approximately 25% oil, 49% natural gas and 26% NGLs). As of June 30, 2018, we had 1,146 gross (463 net) producing wells online, operated and non-operated. Oil and Natural Gas Data Proved Reserves Evaluation of Proved Reserves.

Mr. Graves meets the requirements with regard to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. DeGolyer and MacNaughton does not own an interest in any of our properties, nor is it employed by us on a contingent basis. A copy of DeGolyer and MacNaughtons proved reserve report as of December 31, 2017 is included as Exhibit 99.5 to this Current Report. We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves. Our internal technical team members meet with our independent reserve engineers periodically to review properties and to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. Keith Case is our Corporate Reserves Advisor and primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates by DeGolyer and MacNaughton. Mr. Case holds a Bachelor of Science in petroleum engineering technology, has over 25 years of industry experience and over 10 years of experience in corporate reserves preparation. Additionally, our Reservoir Engineering Manager, Andrew Chodur, assists Mr. Case in the reserves preparation process. He has 13 years of industry experience in reserve estimation and petroleum economics. Mr. Chodur holds a Bachelor of Science in engineering and geology as well as a Master degree in Business Administration. They are supported by a staff of 8 professionals with an average industry experience of 10 years, all of whom hold a Bachelor degree or higher. The preparation of our proved reserve estimates was completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following:  review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by us;  review of reserve estimates by Mr. Chodur or under his direct supervision;  review by our Executive Vice PresidentOperations and Marketing of all of our reported proved reserves, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) additions;  review by our management team of reported proved reserves and significant reserve changes;  direct reporting responsibilities by our ManagerReservoir Engineering to our Executive Vice PresidentOperations and Marketing; and  verification of property ownership by our land department. Estimation of Proved Reserves. Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into four broad categories or methods: (i) production performance-based methods; (ii) material balance-based methods; (iii) volumetric-based methods; and (iv) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance methods for the vast majority of properties. Certain new producing properties with very little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to similar production, both of which are considered to provide a reasonably high degree of accuracy. Non-producing reserve estimates, for developed and undeveloped properties, were forecast using analogy methods. This method provides a reasonably high degree of accuracy for predicting proved developed non-producing (PDNP) and PUD reserves for our properties, due to the abundance of analog data. 13

To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, we considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. Under SEC rules, reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability, and include production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data. Summary of Reserves. The following table presents our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All of our proved reserves are located in the United States. December 31,2017(1) Proved developed reserves: Oil (MBbls) 12,352 Natural gas (MMcf) 259,193 NGLs (MBbls) 24,034 Total (MBoe)(2) 79,585 Proved undeveloped reserves: Oil (MBbls) 25,068 Natural gas (MMcf) 426,676 NGLs (MBbls) 55,544 Total (MBoe)(2) 151,724 Total proved reserves: Oil (MBbls) 37,420 Natural gas (MMcf) 685,869 NGLs (MBbls) 79,578 Total (MBoe)(2) 231,309 Benchmark Oil and Natural Gas Prices(1): OilWTI per Bbl $ 51.34 Natural gasHenry Hub per MMBtu $ 2.98 Standardized measure (in thousands)(3) $ 1,195,669 Pro forma standardized measure (in thousands)(4) $ 956,847 SEC Pricing PV-10 (in thousands)(5) $ 1,195,669 (1) Our estimated net proved reserves were determined using average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months in accordance with SEC guidance adjusted for quality, transportation fees, regional price differentials, and in the case of natural gas, energy content. For oil and NGLs volumes, the average WTI posted price of $51.34 per barrel as of December 31, 2017, was adjusted for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering, transportation fees and distance from market. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of $2.98 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2017, was similarly adjusted for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering, transportation fees and distance from market. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are $49.43 per barrel of oil, $19.00 per barrel of NGLs and $2.78 per Mcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2017.

Under SEC rules, reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability, and include production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data.
Summary of Reserves. The following table presents our estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All of our proved reserves are located in the United States.

(1) Our estimated net proved reserves were determined using average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12 months in accordance with SEC guidance adjusted for quality, transportation fees, regional price differentials, and in the case of natural gas, energy content. For oil and NGLs volumes, the average WTI posted price of $51.34 per barrel as of December 31, 2017, was adjusted for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering, transportation fees and distance from market. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of $2.98 per MMBtu as of December 31, 2017, was similarly adjusted for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering, transportation fees and distance from market. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are $49.43 per barrel of oil, $19.00 per barrel of NGLs and $2.78 per Mcf of natural gas as of December 31, 2017.

(3) As of December 31, 2017, we were a limited liability company and as a result, we were not subject to entity-level U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Following our Reorganization, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Future calculations of standardized measure will include the effects of income taxes on future net cash flow. Please see Risk Factors The standardized measure of our estimated reserves contained in the footnotes to our financial statements is not an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated reserves. (4) Following our Reorganization, we became subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and our future income taxes are dependent on our future taxable income. As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that our pro forma standardized measure would have been approximately $956.9 million, as adjusted to give effect to the present value of approximately $238.8 million of future income taxes as a result of our being treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. We have assumed pro forma tax expense using a 25.7% blended corporate level federal and state tax rate. (5) PV-10 is not a financial measure calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP and generally differs from standardized measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Because Roan LLC was not subject to entity level U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, prior to the Reorganization, as of December 31, 2017, the PV-10 value and standardized measure of our properties were equal. Following our Reorganization, we were subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Future calculations of standardized measure will include the effects of income taxes on future net cash flow. Please see Risk Factors The standardized measure of our estimated reserves contained in the footnotes to our financial statements is not an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated reserves. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. Please see Risk Factors appearing elsewhere in this Current Report. Additional information regarding our proved reserves can be found in the notes to our financial statements included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and in the reserve report of DeGolyer and MacNaughton as of December 31, 2017, which is included as Exhibit 99.5 to this Current Report. PUDs As of December 31, 2017, our PUDs totaled 25,068 MBbls of oil, 426,676 MMcf of natural gas and 55,544 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 151,724 MBoe. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells are drilled and begin production. 15

PUDs
As of December 31, 2017, our PUDs totaled 25,068 MBbls of oil, 426,676 MMcf of natural gas and 55,544 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 151,724 MBoe. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells are drilled and begin production.
15
Prior to August 31, 2017, PUDs were not booked. As a result of the Contribution to Roan LLC and its development plan and capital availability, PUDs were booked during the remainder of 2017. The following table summarizes our changes in PUDs during the year ended December 31, 2017(in MBoe): Balance, December 31, 2016  Purchase of reserves in place 27,920 Revisions of previous estimates (13,245 ) New discoveries and extensions 150,100 Transfers to proved developed (13,051 ) Balance, December 31, 2017 151,724 We purchased 27,920 MBoe during the year ended December 31, 2017. New discoveries and extensions of 150,100 MBoe during the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from new proved undeveloped locations added as a result of our drilling activity. Downward revisions of previous estimates of 13,245 MBoe during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily due to the movement of PUD locations within units and adjustments to the mix of oil and natural gas based on the evaluation of offset well activity in 2017. Additionally, during the period ended December 31, 2017, we spent $148.5 million to convert 13,051 MBoe to proved developed producing reserves. Our estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs at December 31, 2017 were projected to be approximately $715.8 million over the next five years, which we expect to finance through cash flow from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other sources of capital. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years of initial booking. Please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessThe development of our estimated PUDs may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated PUDs may not be ultimately developed or produced. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 7,500 MBoe of our total proved reserves relating to six drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) were classified as PDNP. In January 2018, all six DUCs were completed and reported production. Completion costs associated with these six DUCs were approximately $29.0 million.

The adoption of ASC 606 requires certain costs that were previously recorded as gathering, processing and transportation expenses to be accounted for as a deduction from revenue. We elected the modified retrospective method of transition. Accordingly, comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous revenue standard. (3) Excludes settlements of commodity derivative contracts prior to their contractual maturity. Productive Wells The following table sets forth information as of June 30, 2018 relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of that date. Productive wells consist of producing wells, wells capable of production and wells awaiting connection to production facilities.

Many of the leases comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the leasehold acreage has been established prior to such date, in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 80% of our total net acreage was held by production. The following table sets forth the gross and net undeveloped acreage, as of June 30, 2018, that will expire over the next five years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates.

Through our drilling activity or drilling activity of third parties, we expect to develop approximately 3,200 of the net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2018. Of the 10,434 net acres expiring in 2019 and the 13,346 net acres expiring in 2020, we have the right to extend on 1,344 and 1,779 net acres, respectively, at a cost of approximately $6.7 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Drilling Results The following table sets forth the results of our drilling activity, as defined by wells having been placed on production, for the periods indicated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. Productive wells are those that produce, or are capable of producing, commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return.

Operations General As of June 30, 2018, we operated approximately 76% of our net acreage position. As operator, we design and manage the development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties. Marketing and Customers We market the majority of our production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our oil, natural gas and NGL production to purchasers at market prices, adjusted for quality, transportation fees, regional price differentials, and in the case of natural gas, energy content. While a majority of our natural gas and NGLs is sold under long-term contracts with terms of greater than twelve months, a portion is sold under six-month and month-to-month contracts. We sell all of our oil under contracts with terms of twelve months or less. We normally sell our production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in our business. The following table identifies customers from whom we derived 10% or more of receipts from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Six Months Ended,June 30, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2017 2016 2015 Sunoco Inc. 26 % 42 % 40 % 55 % 61 % EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP 20 % 40 % 39 % 31 % * Coffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing, LLC 19 % * * * * Blue Mountain Midstream, LLC 12 % * * * * Cimarex Energy Company * * * * 14 % * Revenue from customer was less than 10% in this period.

We believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as oil, natural gas and NGLs are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. Transportation During the initial development of our fields, we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure options in the areas of our production which does not have an existing dedication. Our oil is transported from the wellsite tank batteries by truck to terminal pipeline sites or direct to a refinery. Our natural gas is generally transported by third-party gathering lines from the wellhead to a gas processing facility. Competition The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies, many of whom have greater resources than we do. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of complying with existing, and subsequently amended, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
