Item 2.01.Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On August 31, 2018, we closed on the purchase of an existing 286-unit senior housing community, known as Courtyard at Mt. Tabor, located in Portland, Oregon (the Courtyard Property). The Courtyard Property is comprised of independent living (201 units), assisted living (73 units) and memory care (12 units). The Courtyard Property also contains developable land intended to be developed for an additional 23 units of memory care (the Memory Care Expansion). We acquired the Courtyard Property from unaffiliated third parties for a purchase price of $92 million, plus closing and acquisition costs, which was funded with a combination of proceeds from the Freddie Mac Portland Loan and the Portland Bridge Loan, each as described in Item 2.03 below, as well as additional preferred equity financing from an affiliate of our sponsor. In addition, we incurred approximately $1.6 million in acquisition fees owed to our Advisor in connection with this acquisition.
