Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On July 31, 2018, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Nationstar, with Nationstar as the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger, Nationstar became a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMIH.
As a result of the Merger, each share of common stock of Nationstar, par value of $0.01 per share (Nationstar Common Stock), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time) (other than shares held by WMIH or Nationstar and shares held by any holder of Nationstar common stock who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares under Delaware law (all such shares described in this parenthetical, Excluded Shares)) was converted into, subject to automatic proration and adjustment, either (i) if the holder of such share made a valid cash election, $18.00 in cash (the consideration described in this clause (i), the Cash Election Consideration), or (ii) if the holder of such share made a valid stock election (or failed to make a valid election), 12.7793 shares of common stock of WMIH, par value $0.00001 per share (WMIH Common Stock) (the consideration described in this clause (ii), the Stock Election Consideration). Based on the preliminary election results previously announced by WMIH and Nationstar on July 27, 2018, the Cash Election Consideration will be subject to automatic proration and adjustment, as described in the Merger Agreement and in the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus dated May 31, 2018, filed by WMIH with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on June 1, 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the Prospectus), to ensure that the total amount of cash paid (excluding cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) equals exactly $1,225,885,248.00. The Stock Election Consideration will not be prorated. After the final Merger Consideration election results are determined, the final allocation and proration of Merger Consideration will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
For payments to holders of Nationstar Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) in connection with the Merger, WMIH deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the exchange agent for the Merger (the Exchange Agent), a total of approximately 397 million shares of WMIH Common Stock and a total of $1,225,885,248.00 in cash to be issued and paid to Nationstar stockholders, in the aggregate. No fractional shares of WMIH Common Stock were issued in the Merger. Accordingly, Nationstar stockholders became entitled to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of WMIH Common Stock. WMIH will deposit with the Exchange Agent, from time to time, an additional amount in cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, (i) each outstanding share of Nationstar restricted stock automatically vested in full effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and was converted into the right to receive either the Cash Election Consideration or the Stock Election Consideration, as elected by the holder thereof in accordance with the procedures set out in the Merger Agreement and (ii) each outstanding Nationstar restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, automatically vested in full effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, at the Effective Time, was assumed by WMIH and was converted into a WMIH restricted stock unit entitling the holder thereof to receive upon settlement either the Cash Election Consideration or the Stock Election Consideration, as elected by the holder of the Nationstar restricted stock unit award in accordance with the procedures set out in the Merger Agreement, based on the number of shares of Nationstar Common Stock underlying or represented by the number of Nationstar restricted stock unit awards as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Nationstar restricted stock unit awards and Nationstar restricted stock awards that were granted between the signing of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time did not automatically vest solely as a result of the Merger, but instead were automatically assumed by WMIH at the Effective Time and converted into a WMIH restricted stock unit award or restricted stock award, as applicable, with respect to a number of WMIH shares equal to the number of shares of Nationstar Common Stock underlying the award multiplied by the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement (12.7793). Such converted awards have the same vesting schedule as the underlying Nationstar awards and will automatically vest upon a termination of the grantees service without cause (as defined in the applicable award agreement) within 12 months after the Effective Time.
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to WMIHs Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018, and is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01.
