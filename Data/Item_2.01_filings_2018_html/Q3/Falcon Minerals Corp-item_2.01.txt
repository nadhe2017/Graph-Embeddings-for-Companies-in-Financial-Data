The Business Combination was approved by the Companys stockholders at a special meeting of the Companys stockholders held on August 20, 2018 (the Special Meeting). At the Special Meeting, 24,404,853 shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock and the Companys Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class B Common Stock), were voted in favor of the proposal to approve the Business Combination, no shares of the Companys common stock were voted against the proposal, and none of the Companys stockholders abstained from voting on the proposal. None of the Companys public stockholders exercised their right to redeem shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination pursuant to the terms of the Companys first amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Charter). In addition, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination and in accordance with the Charter, all of the 6,875,000 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock were converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.
At the Closing, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Contributors received (i) $400 million of cash and (ii) 40 million Common Units. The Company also issued to the Contributors 40 million shares of non-economic Class C common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class C Common Stock), which entitles each holder to one vote per share.
In addition to the above, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Royal is entitled to receive earn-out consideration to be paid in the form of Common Units (and a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock) if the 30-day volume-weighted average price (30-Day VWAP) of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds certain hurdles set forth in the Contribution Agreement. If the 30-Day VWAP of the Class A Common Stock is $12.50 or more per share at any time within the seven (7) years following the Closing Date, Royal will receive (i) an additional 10 million Common Units (and an equivalent number of shares of Class C Common Stock), plus (ii) an amount of Common Units (and an equivalent number of shares of Class C Common Stock) equal to (x) the amount by which annual cash dividends paid on each share of Class A Common Stock exceeds $0.50 in each year between the Closing Date and the date the first earn-out is achieved (with any dividends paid in the stub year in which the first earn-out is achieved annualized for purposes of determining what portion of such dividends would have, on an annual basis, exceeded $0.50), multiplied by 10 million, (y) divided by $12.50. If the 30-Day VWAP of the Class A Common Stock is $15.00 or more per share at any time within the seven (7) years following the Closing Date (which $15.00 threshold is reduced by the amount by which annual cash dividends paid on each share of Class A Common Stock exceeds $0.50 in each year between the Closing Date and the date the earn-out is achieved, but not below $12.50), Royal will receive an additional 10 million Common Units (and an equivalent number of Class C Common Stock).
Royal is also entitled to the earn-out consideration described above in connection with certain liquidity events of the Company, including a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, if the consideration paid to holders of Class A Common Stock in connection with such liquidity event is greater than any of the above-specified 30-Day VWAP hurdles.

Description of the Companys Securities
The Company has authorized (a) 361,000,000 shares of common stock including (i) 240,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) no shares of Class B Common Stock and (iii) 120,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock and (b) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of the Closing Date, there were: (a) 28 holders of record of Class A Common Stock and 45,855,000 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding; (b) three holders of record of Class C Common Stock and 40,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding; and (c) no shares of preferred stock outstanding. All of the Companys shares of Class B Common Stock were converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Charter.
Class A Common Stock
Holders of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by the Companys stockholders. Holders of the Class A Common Stock and holders of the Class C Common Stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the Companys stockholders, except as required by law or the A&R Charter (as defined herein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or the A&R Charter (including any preferred stock designation), holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to the A&R Charter (including any amendment to any preferred stock designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of preferred stock or other series of common stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock or common stock, as applicable, are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the A&R Charter (including any preferred stock designation) or as required by applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or applicable stock exchange rules.
In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Class A Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the Class A Common Stock.
Class C Common Stock
In connection with the Business Combination, the Company issued 40,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock to the Contributors. A holder of Class C Common Stock may transfer shares of Class C Common Stock to any transferee only if, and only to the extent permitted by the Opco LPA, such holder also simultaneously transfers an equal number of such holders Common Units to such transferee in compliance with the Opco LPA. Holders of our Class C Common Stock will vote together as a single class with holders of our Class A Common Stock on all matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders. In addition, holders of Class C Common Stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to approve any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the A&R Charter (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change, in a manner adverse to the holders of the Class C Common Stock, the powers, preferences or rights of the Class C Common Stock, relative to the powers, preferences or rights of any other class of common stock, as such relative powers, preferences or rights exist as of the date of the A&R Charter.
Under the A&R Charter, no dividends may be declared or paid on shares of Class C Common Stock and holders of Class C Common Stock do not receive any assets of the Company in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. In addition, the Company may not enter into any agreement providing for (i) a merger, consolidation or other business combination requiring the approval of the Companys stockholders, (ii) any acquisition of all or substantially all of the Companys assets or (iii) any tender or exchange offer by the Company or any third party to acquire stock of the Company (collectively, a sale transaction) in which it is proposed that (1) the shares of Class C Common Stock are converted into the right to receive, directly or indirectly, in connection with such sale transaction, any consideration or (2) each share of Class C Common Stock, together with each Common Unit, are converted into the right to receive, in connection with a sale transaction, a different amount of consideration on a per share basis as that received by each share of Class A Common Stock.
Holders of Common Units will generally have the right to cause Opco to redeem all or a portion of their Common Units in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock; provided that the Company may, at its option, effect a direct exchange of such shares of Class A Common Stock for such Common Units in lieu of such a redemption by Opco. Upon the future redemption or exchange of Common Units held by a Contributor, a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock will be cancelled. For more information on the redemption and exchange rights related to the Class C Common Stock and Common Units, see the section of the Proxy Statement entitled Proposal No. 1The Business Combination Proposal beginning on page 82 which is incorporated herein by reference.
Warrants
Public Stockholders Warrants. The companys warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement, dated July 20, 2017, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the warrant agreement). Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of the Companys Class A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of the Companys initial public offering (the initial public offering) or 30 days after the Closing Date. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrantholder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock. This means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrantholder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The warrants will expire five years after the Closing Date, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
14
14
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A Common Stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A Common Stock underlying such unit.
The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of the Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A Common Stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but the Company will be required to use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the warrants for redemption:
in whole and not in part;

in whole and not in part;
at a price of $0.01 per warrant;

at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and

upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and
if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.

if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
The Company has established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A Common Stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price as well as the $11.50 (for whole shares) warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.
15
15
If the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, the Companys management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the Companys management will consider, among other factors, the Companys cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on its stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the its warrants. If the Companys management takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If the Companys management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the fair market value in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. The Company believes this feature is an attractive option to the Company if it does not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after the Business Combination. If the Company calls its warrants for redemption and the Companys management does not take advantage of this option, its sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below.
A holder of a warrant may notify the Company in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such persons affiliates), to the warrant agents actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.
If the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or by a split-up of shares of Class A Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. A rights offering to holders of Class A Common Stock entitling holders to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A Common Stock) multiplied by (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Class A Common Stock paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A Common Stock, in determining the price payable for Class A Common Stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of Class A Common Stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of Class A Common Stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.
In addition, if the Company, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of Class A Common Stock on account of such shares of Class A Common Stock (or other shares of the Companys capital stock into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, or (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock in connection with the Business Combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of Class A Common Stock in respect of such event.
16
16
If the number of outstanding shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of Class A Common Stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock.
Whenever the number of shares of Class A Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of Class A Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of Class A Common Stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.
In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of Class A Common Stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which it is dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of the Companys Class A Common Stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. If less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Class A Common Stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of Class A Common Stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant.
The warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and the Company. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants.
The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to the Company, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A Common Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Class A Common Stock. After the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder is entitled to one (1) vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to the warrant holder. As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest that will not be issued.

A copy of the warrant agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 26, 2017, is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the warrants is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.
Private Placement Warrants. The private placement warrants (including the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination (except, among other limited exceptions to the Companys officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the Companys sponsor) and they are not redeemable by the Company so long as they are held by its sponsor or its permitted transferees. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in the Initial Public Offering. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the Companys sponsor or its permitted transferees, the private placement warrants are redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in the Initial Public Offering.
If holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A Common Stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that the Company has agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Companys sponsor and permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with the Company following the Business Combination. If they remain affiliated with the Company, their ability to sell the Companys securities in the open market will be significantly limited. The Company expects to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling the Companys securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell the Companys securities, an insider cannot trade in its securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the shares of Class A Common Stock received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. As a result, the Company believes that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.
The private placement warrants were sold in a private placement pursuant to a written agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and the Company. Copies of the warrant purchase agreement and the warrant agreement, which were filed as Exhibit 10.4 and Exhibit 4.1, respectively, to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 26, 2017, are incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the private placement warrants is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.
