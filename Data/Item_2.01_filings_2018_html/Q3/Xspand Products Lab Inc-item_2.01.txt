At Closing, the Company paid consideration of: (i) $700,000 in cash to Edison Nation ($550,000 of which was subsequently used to purchase the membership interests of Access Innovation, LLC, which membership interests were then distributed to the Members), and (ii) $250,000 in cash to be used to pay off a portion of the indebtedness owed by Edison Nation to holders of certain senior convertible debt.
