Item 2.01.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
Effective September 1, 2018, Charter Financial Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the 'Company") was acquired by CenterState Bank Corporation, a Florida corporation ("CenterState") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 24, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement") through the merger of Charter with and into CenterState (the "Merger"), with CenterState as the surviving entity in the Merger. Immediately thereafter, the Company's direct wholly-owned subsidiary bank, CharterBank, merged with and into CenterState's direct wholly-owned subsidiary bank, CenterState Bank, N.A. ("CenterState Bank"), with CenterState Bank as the surviving national bank subsidiary of CenterState (the "Bank Merger" and collectively with the Merger, the "Mergers").
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company's stockholders received (i) 0.738 of a share of CenterState common stock (the "Stock Consideration") and (ii) $2.30 in cash (the "Cash Consideration" and together with the Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. No fractional shares of CenterState common stock were issued in the Merger and any fractional share of CenterState common stock was paid in cash in the amount of $29.71 per share.
At the effective time of the Merger, each option to acquire shares of the Company's common stock vested and was converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Charter common stock underlying such option and (ii) $23.00 minus the exercise price per share under such option. In addition, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding unvested share of restricted stock of the Company became vested in full and was treated as an outstanding share of the Company's common stock.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and related transactions (including, without limitation, the Mergers) in this Form 8-K does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 2.1.
