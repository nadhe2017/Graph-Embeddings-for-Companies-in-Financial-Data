Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Effective September 1, 2018, Renasant Corporation (Renasant) completed its previously-announced merger with Brand Group Holdings, Inc. (Brand), the parent company of The Brand Banking Company (BrandBank), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Renasant, Renasant Bank, Brand and BrandBank dated as of March 28, 2018 (as amended, the Merger Agreement), in a transaction valued at approximately $474 million. At closing, Brand merged with and into Renasant, with Renasant the surviving corporation in the merger (the Merger); immediately thereafter, BrandBank merged with and into Renasant Bank, with Renasant Bank the surviving banking corporation in the merger.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, holders of Brand common stock have the right to receive 31.72 shares of Renasant common stock and $74.57 in cash for each share of Brand common stock held immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon completion of the Merger, each in-the-money stock option granted under Brands 2010 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan vested in full and was converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to (1) the total number of shares of Brand common stock subject to such stock option multiplied by (2) the difference between $1,519 and the exercise price of the option, less applicable tax withholdings. Out-of-the-money Brand stock options were canceled for no consideration.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Merger does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the description thereof previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Renasant on March 30, 2018, under Item 1.01, Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement, which description is incorporated herein by reference, and by the Merger Agreement itself, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
