Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On July 17, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of the Properties from the Seller. The Company funded the acquisition with a $19,900,000 borrowing from the the Company's secured revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo N.A. (the "Credit Facility"). Of the $19,900,000 borrowed, approximately $9,642,000 is from existing borrowing capacity on previously acquired properties, while approximately $10,258,000 is allocated to the Properties. The Credit Facility bears interest at a variable per annum rate equal to the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.60%, payable monthly, which equated to approximately 3.7% at the time of acquisition for these borrowings. With these borrowings, the Company's eleven properties, including two properties that are not borrowers under the Credit Facility, have a combined loan-to-cost ratio of approximately 54.7%, and the Company has an overall loan-to-value ratio of approximately 46.4%.
The Properties consists of three warehouse distribution buildings: one 182,919 square foot industrial property located in Miami Lakes ("Palmetto Lakes Distribution), and two industrial properties that are 57,000 square feet and 50,000 square feet located in Hialeah (Hialeah I and Hialeah II, respectively). Each Property has an urban, in-fill location within established industrial submarkets in Miami. Palmetto Lakes Distribution is located just north of the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport and less than one mile from the Palmetto Expressway, allowing for connectivity to the rest of Miami-Dade County to the south and Broward County to the north. Hialeah I & Hialeah II are located 5 miles from Miami International Airport and 8 miles from Port Miami, providing tenants with direct access to these major port and air cargo hubs. Each Property is fully occupied by one tenant, with a weighted average lease term remaining across the Properties of four years.
