Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On August 29, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company purchased a multifamily community located in Matthews, North Carolina (the North Carolina Property) from an unaffiliated seller. The North Carolina Property is an apartment community with 212 units and amenities, including a swimming pool, clubhouse, a fitness center, playgrounds, and a dog park. The North Carolina Property encompasses 199,744 rentable square feet. The North Carolina Property was constructed in 1998 and is currently 96% leased.
The contract purchase price of the North Carolina Property was $33.8 million, excluding closing costs. The Company funded the purchase price with proceeds from its ongoing public offering and proceeds from the mortgage loan discussed in Item 2.03 below. The Company believes that the North Carolina Property is suitable for its intended purpose and adequately insured; however, the Company intends to make certain renovations to the unit interiors of the North Carolina Property.
