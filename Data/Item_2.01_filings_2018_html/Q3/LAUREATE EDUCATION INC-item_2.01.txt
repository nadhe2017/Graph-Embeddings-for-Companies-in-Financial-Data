Upon completion of the sale, the Seller received consideration of one dollar and the Seller paid the Buyer $14.0 million to support the Buyers construction of facilities for the acquired culinary arts, baking and pastry, and hospitality programs on Buyers campus, subject to possible partial recoupment under specified conditions during the 10-year period post-closing.

to the Buyer for a working capital adjustment and other items provided for under the Agreement.
At the closing date of the sale, the cease-use criteria was met for a leased building that was not part of the sale transaction and that has a lease term ending in July 2028. Accordingly, the pro forma financial statements, included at the end of this Current Report on Form 8-K, reflect a liability for a cease-use accrual of approximately $24 million, recorded as of the sale date. The cease-use accrual represents the present value of the remaining lease costs, less estimated sublease income.
