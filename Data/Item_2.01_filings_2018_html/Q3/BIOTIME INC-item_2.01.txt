Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated into this Item 2.01 by reference.
On August 30, 2018, BioTime consummated the sale of AgeX Shares to Juvenescence. Prior to the Transaction, Juvenescence owned 5.6% of AgeXs issued and outstanding common stock. Upon completion of the Transaction, BioTimes ownership in AgeX decreased from 80.4% to 40.2% of AgeXs issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and Juvenescences ownership in AgeX increased from 5.6% to 45.8% of AgeXs issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
As a result of the consummation of the Transaction on August 30, 2018, AgeX is no longer a subsidiary of BioTime and, as of that date, BioTime experienced a loss of control of AgeX, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Loss of control is deemed to have occurred when, among other things, a parent company owns less than a majority of the outstanding common stock of a subsidiary, lacks a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary, and is unable to unilaterally control the subsidiary through other means such as having, or being able to obtain, the power to elect a majority of the subsidiarys Board of Directors based solely on contractual rights or ownership of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the subsidiarys voting securities. All of these loss-of-control factors were present with respect to BioTimes ownership interest in AgeX as of August 30, 2018. Accordingly, BioTime has deconsolidated AgeXs consolidated financial statements and results from BioTimes consolidated financial statements and results effective on August 30, 2018 (the AgeX Deconsolidation), in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 810-10-40-4(c), Consolidation. AgeX is currently an affiliate of BioTime.
Consolidation
Beginning on August 30, 2018 and until the completion of the contemplated distribution of approximately 12,700,000 shares of AgeX common stock to BioTime shareholders (the Distribution), BioTime will account for its retained noncontrolling interest of AgeX common stock under the equity method of accounting because its 40.2% retained ownership interest provides BioTime the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of AgeX. In addition, because BioTime expects AgeX common stock to become a publicly traded security, BioTime plans to elect the fair value option under ASC 825-10, Financial Instruments, with subsequent changes in the fair value of AgeX common stock recognized in its consolidated statements of operations. This Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of that jurisdiction.
