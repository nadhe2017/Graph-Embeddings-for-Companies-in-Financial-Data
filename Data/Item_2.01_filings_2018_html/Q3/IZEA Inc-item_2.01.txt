On July 26, 2018, IZEA, Inc. (IZEA) completed its merger with TapInfluence, Inc. (TapInfluence), pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 11, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among IZEA, IZEA Merger Sub, Inc., TapInfluence, certain stockholders of TapInfluence and the stockholders representative, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, dated as of July 20, 2018. The Merger Agreement was previously described in the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 12, 2018.
At closing, IZEA paid to TapInfluence stockholders the sum of $1,500,000 less an estimated closing working capital adjustment of negative $181,633 in cash, and issued 1,150,000 shares of IZEA common stock valued at $1,759,500 based on the $1.53 closing market price of IZEA's common stock on July 26, 2018. IZEA will pay TapInfluence stockholders an additional $4,500,000 in the form of cash, common stock or a combination thereof, at IZEAs option, in two installments - $1,000,000 six months after the closing date and $3,500,000 twelve months after the closing date of the merger. Stock issuances, if any, will be determined based on the 30 trading day volume-weighted average price per share of IZEA common stock prior to the payment date. Future cash payments and stock issuances may be withheld from the six month or twelve month payment for post closing working capital adjustments and to satisfy indemnifiable claims made by IZEA with respect to any misrepresentations or breaches of warranty under the Merger Agreement by TapInfluence or the stockholders of TapInfluence within 12 months after the closing date of the merger.
The Merger Agreement for the transaction was included as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 12, 2018.
On July 20, 2018, the parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things, (i) that a portion of the fee owed by TapInfluence to Mooreland Partners LLC, its financial advisor, in connection with the closing will be paid in IZEA common stock at closing and a portion of such fee will be deferred until payment of the deferred payments and (ii) for updates to the parties disclosure schedules.
