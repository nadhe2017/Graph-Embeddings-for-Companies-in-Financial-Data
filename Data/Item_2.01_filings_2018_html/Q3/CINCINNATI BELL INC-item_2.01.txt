On July 2, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated as of July 9, 2017, among the Company, Twin Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), and Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Hawaiian Telcom), Merger Sub merged with and into Hawaiian Telcom (the Merger), with Hawaiian Telcom surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
As a result of the Merger, each share of Hawaiian Telcoms common stock, par value $0.01 (Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), other than shares of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock held by (i) Hawaiian Telcom as treasury stock, (ii) the Company or Merger Sub, (iii) any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Hawaiian Telcom or (iv) any Hawaiian Telcom stockholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, was cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, at the holder of such shares election and subject to proration as set forth in the Merger Agreement and as described below:
(i) 1.6305 common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the Company Common Shares) (the Share Consideration);
(i)
1.6305 common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the Company Common Shares) (the Share Consideration);
(ii) 0.6522 Company Common Shares and $18.45 in cash, without interest (the Mixed Consideration); or
(ii)
0.6522 Company Common Shares and $18.45 in cash, without interest (the Mixed Consideration); or
(iii) $30.75 in cash, without interest (the Cash Consideration, together with and any combination of, the Share Consideration and the Mixed Consideration, the Merger Consideration).
(iii)
$30.75 in cash, without interest (the Cash Consideration, together with and any combination of, the Share Consideration and the Mixed Consideration, the Merger Consideration).
As a result of the Merger, (i) each Hawaiian Telcom restricted stock unit granted on or after January 1, 2017 that did not provide for automatic vesting upon the consummation of the Merger was converted at the Effective Time into a time-based restricted stock unit of the Company (with any applicable performance criteria deemed satisfied at target) in respect of a number of Company Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) based on an exchange ratio of 1.8274 (each, an Assumed RSU) and (ii) each other Hawaiian Telcom restricted stock unit (each, a Cash-Out RSU) was cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive in respect of each share of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out RSU (with any applicable performance criteria calculated based on actual performance), without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding, at the holder of such Cash-Out RSUs election and subject to proration as set forth in the Merger Agreement and as described above, one or more forms of the Merger Consideration.
As previously announced by the Company and Hawaiian Telcom, the deadline for holders of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock or Cash-Out RSUs to make an election as to the form of Merger Consideration was 5:00 p.m., New York time, on June 21, 2018 (the Election Deadline). Each share of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock or each Cash-Out RSU in respect of which a timely and proper election was not made prior to the Election Deadline was cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Mixed Consideration.
Elections made in respect of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock or Cash-Out RSUs to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration are subject to proration as set forth in the Merger Agreement to ensure that the aggregate number of Company Common Shares issued by the Company in the Merger and the aggregate amount of cash paid by the Company in the Merger will be the same as if all electing holders received the Mixed Consideration. No fractional Company Common Shares will be issued in the Merger and holders of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock and Cash-Out RSUs will receive cash in lieu of fractional Company Common Shares, if any.
In connection with the Merger, the Company paid in cash $218,300,658.30 and issued 7,716,840 Company Common Shares in aggregate Merger Consideration. In addition, the Company reserved for issuance 148,625 Company Common Shares in respect of the Assumed RSUs in connection with the Companys assumption of the Hawaiian Telcom 2010 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Upon the closing of the Merger, the shares of Hawaiian Telcom Common Stock, which previously traded under the ticker symbol HCOM on The NASDAQ Stock Market (the NASDAQ), ceased trading on, and were delisted from, the NASDAQ.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K, filed by the Company on July 10, 2017 with the SEC, and is incorporated herein by reference.
