Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On July 6, 2018, pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of December 11, 2017 (the Merger Agreement) between TriCo Bancshares (TriCo) and FNB Bancorp (FNB), FNB merged with and into TriCo with TriCo continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). Immediately after the Merger, First National Bank of Northern California, the wholly owned bank subsidiary of FNB (First National Bank), merged with and into Tri Counties Bank, the wholly owned bank subsidiary of TriCo, with Tri Counties Bank continuing as the surviving bank.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of FNB common stock (other than shares owned by FNB directly or indirectly, which shares were cancelled) was converted into the right to receive 0.98 of a share of TriCo common stock. For each fractional share that would have otherwise been issued, TriCo will pay cash in an amount equal to such fraction of a share multiplied by $39.267, which was the average of the closing prices for shares of TriCo Common Stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on June 28, 2018 (the Average Closing Price).
Immediately prior to the closing, each outstanding option to purchase shares of FNB common stock, whether or not then vested and exercisable, was cancelled and the holder of the option was entitled to receive from FNB, subject to any required tax withholding, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the excess over the exercise price per share, if any, of 0.98 multiplied by the Average Closing Price.
As a result of the Merger, TriCo will deliver approximately 7.4 million shares of TriCo common stock to the former holders of FNB common stock. Giving effect to the issuance of such shares, there will be approximately 30.4 million shares of TriCo common stock outstanding as of July 6, 2018, of which former holders of FNB common stock, as a group, will hold approximately 24.3% and holders of TriCo common stock immediately prior to the merger, as a group, will own approximately 75.7%. Based on TriCos closing stock price of $38.41 on July 6, 2018, the merger consideration was valued at approximately $37.50 per share of FNB common stock or $284.5 million in the aggregate (excluding amounts paid on account of the canceled stock options).
This description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to TriCos Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 12, 2017 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
