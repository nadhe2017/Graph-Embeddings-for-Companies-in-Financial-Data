At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each common unit representing a limited partner interest in ETP (each, an ETP Common Unit) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any ETP Common Units owned by ETE and its subsidiaries) was converted into the right to receive 1.28 (the Exchange Ratio) common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the Partnership Common Units) (such units, the Merger Consideration). Each Class E Unit, Class G Unit and Class K Unit of ETP, as well as each Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Unit, Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Unit, Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Unit and Series D Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Unit of ETP (collectively, the ETP Preferred Units), issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time continued to be issued and outstanding and to represent a limited partner interest in ETP at and after the Effective Time. Each unvested award of restricted units or restricted phantom units granted under any ETP equity plan (collectively, the ETP Restricted Units) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was automatically converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive an award of restricted units of ETE (a Converted Restricted Unit Award) on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding award of ETP Restricted Units, except that the number of ETE restricted units covered by each such Converted Restricted Unit Award was equal to the number of ETP Restricted Units multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
