Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On November 12, 2018, EQT completed the previously announced separation of its midstream business from its upstream business (the Separation). The Separation was effected by the transfer of the midstream business from EQT to ETRN and the distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding shares of ETRN common stock to EQT's shareholders (the Distribution). EQT's shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 1, 2018 (the Record Date) were entitled to receive 0.80 shares of ETRN common stock for every one share of EQT common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. EQT did not distribute fractional shares of ETRN common stock in the Distribution. Fractional shares that EQT's shareholders would have otherwise been entitled to receive are being aggregated and sold in the public market by the distribution agent. The aggregate net cash proceeds of these sales will be distributed ratably to those shareholders who would otherwise have been entitled to receive fractional shares, in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. EQT retained 19.9% of the outstanding shares of ETRN common stock.
As a result of the Distribution, ETRN is now an independent public company trading under the ticker symbol ETRN on the New York Stock Exchange.
