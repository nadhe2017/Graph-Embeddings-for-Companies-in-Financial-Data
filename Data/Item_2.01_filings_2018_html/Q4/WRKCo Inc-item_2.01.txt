Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On November 2, 2018, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Mergers were consummated and became effective as of the Effective Time. As a result of the Mergers, among other things, WestRock became the ultimate parent of WRKCo, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries. The Mergers and the Merger Agreement were previously described in the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time (a) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of WRKCo (WRKCo common stock) was converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of WestRock (WestRock common stock) and (b) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of KapStone (KapStone common stock) (other than shares of KapStone common stock owned by (i) KapStone or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) any KapStone stockholder who properly exercised appraisal rights with respect to its shares of KapStone common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) was automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive (1) $35.00 in cash, without interest (the Cash Consideration), or, at the election of the holder of such share of KapStone common stock, (2) 0.4981 shares of WestRock common stock (the Stock Consideration) and cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to proration procedures designed to ensure that the Stock Consideration would be received in respect of no more than 25% of the shares of KapStone common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the Maximum Stock Amount). Each share of KapStone common stock in respect of which a valid election of Stock Consideration was not made by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on September 5, 2018 (the Election Deadline) was converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

KapStone stockholders elected to receive Stock Consideration that was less than the Maximum Stock Amount and no proration was required. As a result, KapStone stockholders will receive in the aggregate approximately $3.3 billion in cash and 1,564,992 shares of WestRock common stock, which equals 0.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of WestRock common stock immediately following the Effective Time.
In addition, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, WestRock assumed all of the equity-based incentive plans maintained by WRKCo, and all equity-based awards under such plans were converted into an equal number of equity-based awards with respect to WestRock common stock, but otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.
The shares of WRKCo common stock will be suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) prior to the open of trading on November 5, 2018. Shares of WestRock common stock will continue regular-way trading on the NYSE using WRKCos trading history under the ticker symbol WRK immediately following the suspension of trading of WRKCo common stock. The description of WestRock common stock set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is incorporated herein by reference.
