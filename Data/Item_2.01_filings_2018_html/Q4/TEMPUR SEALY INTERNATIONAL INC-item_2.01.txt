Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On December 28, 2018, a subsidiary of Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (the "Company") in Latin America completed a transaction pursuant to which it sold substantially all of its assets to Bed Time S.A., an unrelated third party, for approximately $2.6 million in cash, subject to certain working capital adjustments to be determined within 150 days (which may be extended by up to 90 days under certain circumstances) of the closing (the "Transaction"). The Transaction was entered into in connection with the Company's previously disclosed evaluation of its International business segment operations pursuant to which it identified certain Latin American subsidiaries with low profitability and difficult operating environments with higher operational risk and volatility. As a result of this evaluation, the Company decided to divest of the net assets of its Latin American subsidiaries and enter into licensee relationships in those markets.
