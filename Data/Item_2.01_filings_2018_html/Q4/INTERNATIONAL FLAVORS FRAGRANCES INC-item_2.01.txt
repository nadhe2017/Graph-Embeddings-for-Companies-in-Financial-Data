Item 2.01.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On October 4, 2018, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF) completed its previously announced acquisition of Frutarom Industries Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel (Frutarom), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 7, 2018 (as amended on August 25, 2018, the Merger Agreement), among IFF, Frutarom and Icon Newco Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel and a wholly owned subsidiary of IFF (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Frutarom (the Merger), with Frutarom continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of IFF.
As a result of the Merger, each ordinary share, par value NIS 1.00 per share, of Frutarom (the Frutarom Ordinary Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time) (other than Frutarom Ordinary Shares held by Frutarom as treasury stock (dormant shares) or held directly or indirectly by IFF, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Frutarom) was converted into the right to receive (i) $71.19 in cash (the Cash Consideration) and (ii) 0.2490 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassesable share of common stock, par value $0.125 per share, of IFF (IFF Common Stock), with cash in lieu of fractional shares of IFF Common Stock otherwise issuable (such shares of IFF Common Stock and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash Consideration, the Merger Consideration), in each case without interest and subject to applicable tax withholding.
At the Effective Time, each Frutarom option and Frutarom restricted stock award that was outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, was canceled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each net share subject to such vested option or award, less applicable tax withholding. For this purpose, net share means, with respect to an option or award, the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration (calculated as specified in the Merger Agreement) over the exercise price or purchase price per Frutarom Ordinary Share (as applicable) subject to such option or award, multiplied by (B) the number of Frutarom Ordinary Shares subject to such option or award, divided by (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration.
At the Effective Time, each Frutarom option and each Frutarom restricted stock award that was outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was canceled and converted into the right of the applicable holder to receive, on the applicable vesting date that applies to such unvested option or award, subject to the holders continued employment with Frutarom or an affiliate through such date, a cash payment in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (i) the total number of Frutarom Ordinary Shares subject to such option or restricted stock award multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price or purchase price per Frutarom Ordinary Share (as applicable) subject to such unvested equity award, less applicable tax withholding.
