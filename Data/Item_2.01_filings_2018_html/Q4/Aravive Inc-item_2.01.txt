The Merger became effective on October 12, 2018, when the certificate of merger of Aravive and Merger Sub was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the Effective Time).

The aggregate consideration issuable in the Merger to the former security holders of Aravive, without giving effect to any adjustment for the reverse stock split described below under Item 5.03, was approximately 30,851,600 shares of Company Common Stock and options to purchase approximately 7,103,859 shares of Company Common Stock. On October 15, 2018, Versartis changed its name to Aravive, Inc. (the Combined Company).
