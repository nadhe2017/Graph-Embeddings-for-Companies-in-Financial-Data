Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On December 3, 2018, Royale Energy, Inc. (Royale) completed the previously announced acquisition of interests in oil fields from West Coast Energy Properties Limited Partnership (WCE), a privately held limited partnership, pursuant to a September 19, 2018 agreement with WCE (the WCE Agreement). Royale directly acquired non-operated interests in the Jameson North field in the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Big Mineral Creek field in the Marietta Basin in North Texas. Royales joint venture partner, RMX Energy, LLC (RMX), acquired non-operated interests in the Whittier field in the LA Basin and Bellevue field in the San Joaquin Basin in California.
Prior to completion of the acquisition, Royale entered into an agreement with its joint venture partner, RMX Energy, LLC (RMX), under which RMX assumed certain rights and obligations under the WCE Agreement with WCE. Pursuant to the agreement between Royale and RMX:
 Royale acquired the Jameson North and Big Mineral Creek interests in Texas and has become the operator of the Jameson North field. If Royale sells the Jameson North and/or Big Mineral Creek interests within on or before December 3, 2019, RMX will be entitled to receive 50% of the sales proceeds.

 RMX paid the agreed purchase price stated in the WCE Agreement to WCE and in exchange received the interests in the Whittier field and Bellevue field in California where Royale already has a joint venture with RMX Resources. Royale also assigned RMX an overriding royalty interest in the Jameson North interests, of 3% of production in excess of base production of 37 barrels of oil per day. If Royale sells the all of the Jameson North interests, the 3% override will terminate.

An affiliate of Royale is currently the operator of the West Whittier and Bellevue leases. Royale agreed that if it is named the operator of those West Whittier and Bellevue lease interests which were acquired by RMX under the WCE Agreement, Royale will reduce its monthly management services fee, currently being paid to Royale by RMX, by $50,000 per month.
The WCE Agreement was previously filed with the SEC as Exhibit 2.1 to Royales Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 20, 2018, and the agreement between Royale and RMX Resources was filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.31 to Royales Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The above discussion should be read in conjunction with these two agreements for a complete set of the terms and conditions of the acquisition.
