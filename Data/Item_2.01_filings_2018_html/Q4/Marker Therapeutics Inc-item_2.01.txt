On October 17, 2018, the Merger was consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. At the effective time of the Merger, the Marker stockholders received (i) an aggregate of 13,914,255 shares of TapImmunes common stock which equaled the number of shares of TapImmune common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, and (ii) an aggregate of 5,046,003 warrants, at an exercise price of $2.99 per share with a five-year term, which equaled the number of TapImmune warrants and stock options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.
After taking into account the issuance of shares in the Financing described above, immediately following the effective time of the Merger, the pro forma ownership of the issued and outstanding shares of TapImmune common stock on a fully diluted basis (assuming all issued and outstanding warrants and options are exercised) will be approximately as follows: Markers former stockholders 27.5%, TapImmunes stockholders prior to the Merger 27.5%, and the private placement stockholders 45%. Following the completion of the Merger and the Financing, there were 45,328,510 issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock.
The issuance of the shares of Company common stock to the former stockholders of Marker in connection with the Merger and related transactions was approved by the Companys stockholders at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the 2018 Annual Meeting) held on October 16, 2018.
In connection with the Merger, the Company filed an amendment to its articles of incorporation in Nevada to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 41,666,667 shares to 150,000,000 shares and to change the Companys name to Marker Therapeutics, Inc. (Certificate of Amendment). The Company then reincorporated from a Nevada corporation to a Delaware corporation and filed its certificate of incorporation in Delaware. Finally, a certificate of merger was filed in Delaware to merge Marker Cell Therapy, Inc. (f/k/a Marker Therapeutics, Inc.) with and into Merger Sub, with Marker Cell Therapy, Inc. being the surviving corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The name change, reincorporation and Merger were all effective as of October 17, 2018. Beginning as of the market open on October 18, 2018, shares of the Companys common stock will commence trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the new ticker symbol MRKR and will have a new CUSIP number, 57055L 107.
