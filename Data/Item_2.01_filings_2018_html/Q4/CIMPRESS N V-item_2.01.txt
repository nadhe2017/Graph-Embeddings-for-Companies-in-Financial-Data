Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On October 1, 2018, Cimpress USA Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cimpress N.V., completed its previously announced acquisition of Build A Sign LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("BuildASign"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated September 23, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement") among Cimpress N.V., Cimpress USA Incorporated, and Cimpress Acquisition, LLC, as buyers (collectively, "Cimpress"); BAS Buyer, LLC, BAS NewCo, LLC, and Build A Sign Management Pool, LLC (the "Management Pool"), as sellers (collectively, the "Sellers"); and BuildASign as the target. Cimpress acquired approximately 99% of the outstanding equity interests of BuildASign for a purchase price of $274,189,396 in cash, subject to further post-closing adjustment based on acquired cash, debt, and working capital as of the closing date, as well as transaction expenses. The Management Pool retained approximately 1% of the outstanding equity interests of BuildASign for the benefit of certain BuildASign employees who hold equity interests in the Management Pool, and Cimpress and the holders of the Management Pool interests entered into a put and call option agreement with respect to the retained BuildASign equity interests.
Under the Merger Agreement, $6,150,000 of the purchase price was deposited into escrow accounts to cover any shortfall from agreed levels of BuildASign's net cash, debt, and working capital at closing and to secure certain obligations of the Sellers. The parties also jointly purchased a $28,000,000 buy-side representation and warranty insurance policy containing customary terms and conditions to supplement the escrow funds with respect to breaches of Sellers' representations and warranties and the pre-closing tax indemnity.
The foregoing is not a complete description of the parties rights and obligations under the Merger Agreement and is qualified by reference to the full text and terms of such agreement, which was filed as an exhibit to Cimpress' current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, 2018 and incorporated herein by reference.
