Item 2.01.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On December 21, 2018, Drive Shack Inc. (the Company) consummated the sale of 10 golf courses, consisting of Canyon Oaks Country Club in Chico, CA, El Camino Country Club in Oceanside, CA, Monterey Country Club in Palm Desert, CA, Oakhurst Country Club in Clayton, CA, Oregon Golf Club in West Linn, OR, Palm Valley Country Club in Palm Desert, CA, Plantation Country Club in Garden City, ID, Seascape Golf Club in Aptos, CA, Sunset Hills Country Club in Thousand Oaks, CA, and Wood Ranch Golf Club in Simi Valley, CA.
The aggregate gross cash proceeds from these 10 sales and the sale of The Trophy Club of Apalachee in Dacula, GA, which the Company completed on December 19, 2018, equaled approximately $82.5 million, prior to taking into account transaction fees and certain adjustments to the contract sale price based on course assets and liabilities at the time of sale. The Company applied the aggregate net proceeds of the course sales, plus additional cash on hand, to prepay outstanding third-party financing under credit facilities established in June 2016 on 22 traditional owned golf properties (including each of those referred to in this Current Report on Form 8-K) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $102 million. Concurrently with this prepayment, the Company terminated these credit facilities.
The buyers of the golf courses consisted of various individuals and privately-held entities. None of the buyers had any material relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any director or officer of the registrant, or any associate of any director or officer of the Company.
