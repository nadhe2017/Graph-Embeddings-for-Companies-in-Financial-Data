Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets Item 3.02 Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities On October 1, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among AeroCentury Corp., a Delaware corporation ("AeroCentury"), JetFleet Holding Corp. ("JetFleet") and Falcon Landing, Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of AeroCentury ("Merger Sub") and certain other parties, AeroCentury acquired JetFleet by way of merger of JetFleet with Merger Sub, with JetFleet surviving the merger. The merger was consummated following the approval and adoption of the merger and the Merger Agreement by both the JetFleet and AeroCentury shareholders. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of JetFleet common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time was cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) 0.357 shares of AeroCentury common stock and (ii) $7.83 in cash. As a result, AeroCentury is issuing approximately 129,286 shares of its common stock and will pay approximately $2.84 million in cash to the former JetFleet shareholders as a result of the merger. JetFleet shareholders will receive cash for any fractional shares of AeroCentury common stock which they might otherwise have received in the merger. Ten percent of the merger consideration will be held in escrow until December 15, 2018, after which point, such consideration, net of any indemnification claims by AeroCentury pursuant to the Merger Agreement, will be distributed to the former JetFleet shareholders. The California Department of Business Oversight issued a permit for the issuance by AeroCentury of its Common Stock in the merger on February 22, 2018, after a fairness hearing conducted under California Corporations Code Section 25142. As a result, the issuance of AeroCentury Common Stock in the merger was exempt for registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the shares of AeroCentury Common Stock received in the merger by the former JetFleet shareholders will be freely tradable without restriction. The foregoing description of the merger and the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to AeroCentury's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 30, 2017.
