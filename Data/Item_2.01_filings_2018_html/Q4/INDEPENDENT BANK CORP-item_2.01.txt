Results of Merger Consideration Elections and Pro-rations
The results of the elections made by MNB shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement as to the form and consideration to be received due to the Merger are as follows:

Due to the pro-ration required by the oversubscription of cash elections, MNB shareholders who validly elected to receive cash for all of their shares or a portion of their shares will receive $275.00 in cash, without interest, for 66.177167% of their shares so elected and 3.55 shares of Independent common stock for 33.822833% of their shares so elected.

As a result of the elections and pro-ration described above, MNB shareholders will receive an aggregate of 528,353 shares of Independent common stock and an aggregate of approximately $13,644,263 in cash, which does not include cash in lieu of fractional shares.
