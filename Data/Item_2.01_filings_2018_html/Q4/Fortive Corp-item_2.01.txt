Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
The Exchange Offer expired at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on September 26, 2018. Under the terms of the Exchange Offer, 35,000,000 shares of Newco common stock were exchanged for each share of Fortive common stock accepted in the Exchange Offer. Fortive accepted 15,824,931 shares of its common stock in exchange for the 35,000,000 shares of Newco common stock owned by Fortive after proration as described below.
Because the Exchange Offer was oversubscribed, Fortive accepted tendered shares of its common stock on a pro rata basis in proportion to the total number of shares validly tendered and accepted for exchange. Stockholders who owned fewer than 100 shares of Fortive common stock, or an odd lot of such shares, and who validly tendered all of their shares, were not subject to proration in accordance with the terms of the Exchange Offer. The final proration factor of approximately 11.6114% was applied to all other shares of Fortive common stock that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn to determine the number of such shares that were accepted from each tendering stockholder.
Based on the final count by the exchange agent, Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the final results of the Exchange Offer are as follows:
Total number of shares of Fortive common stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn:128,334,418Odd-lot shares tendered that were not subject to proration:1,044,789Total number of shares of Fortive common stock accepted:15,824,931
Total number of shares of Fortive common stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn:128,334,418

1,044,789
Total number of shares of Fortive common stock accepted:15,824,931
15,824,931
Immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer, the Merger closed effective as of October 1, 2018. In the Merger, each share of Newco common stock outstanding immediately following the Exchange Offer (except for shares of Newco common stock held by Fortive, Newco, Altra or Merger Sub, which shares were canceled and ceased to exist, and no consideration was delivered in exchange therefor) was converted into one share of Altra common stock (with stockholders entitled to cash in lieu of fractional shares). As of the completion of the Merger, holders of Fortive common stock who participated in the Exchange Offer owned approximately 54% of Altras outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis. As part of the Transaction, Fortive has also completed the Direct Sales and received approximately $1.4 billion in cash proceeds and retirement of outstanding debt securities.
As a result of the Transaction, Fortive reduced its common stock outstanding by 15,824,931 shares of its common stock.
