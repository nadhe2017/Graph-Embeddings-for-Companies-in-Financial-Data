By virtue of the Merger, each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Common Stock), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time the Merger became effective (the Effective Time) (other than shares held by Merger Sub, Parent (including shares held by the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and its affiliates, certain related parties and certain other parties, collectively the Rollover Stockholders) and by the Company in treasury (Excluded Shares), each share of Common Stock held by any wholly-owned Company subsidiary, and shares of Common Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected such holders right to appraisal of such shares in accordance with applicable law (Dissenting Shares)), were converted into the right to receive $14.75 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration), and were automatically canceled and have ceased to exist. Each share of Company common stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Merger Sub or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time was canceled without the right to receive any payment with respect thereto. Each share of Company common stock held by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time remained outstanding in accordance with its terms.
