Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
As described in the Introductory Note above, on October 13, 2018, Merger Sub irrevocably accepted for purchase and payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Expiration Date (excluding Shares with respect to which notices of guaranteed delivery were delivered). On October 15, 2018, the Merger was completed pursuant to Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL, with no stockholder vote of the Company required to consummate the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moodys.
The aggregate consideration paid by Merger Sub in the Offer and Merger and the related payments for options and restricted stock units was approximately $278 million, without giving effect to related transaction fees and expenses. Moodys provided Merger Sub with the necessary funds to fund the Offer and the Merger through available cash on hand and borrowings at prevailing effective rates under Moodys commercial paper program.
