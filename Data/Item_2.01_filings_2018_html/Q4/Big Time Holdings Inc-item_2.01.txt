Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Turner Wright Ltd.
On October 22, 2018, Big Time Holdings, Inc. (the Company), entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Turner Wright Agreement) with Turner Wright Ltd. (Turner Wright or Seller), a Nigerian corporation with the registered address: 15 Adenekan Salako Close Off Ogba-Ijaiye Road, Lagos, Nigeria. Turner Wright Ltd. is controlled by Dr. Tunde Laval, who fills the role of Chairman and CEO.
The Boards of Directors of the Company and Turner Wright Ltd. have determined that an acquisition of seventy percent (70%) of the outstanding shares of the Seller by the Company through a share exchange (the "Exchange") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Turner Wright Agreement, would be fair and in the best interests of the Company and the Seller, and the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Seller have approved such Exchange, pursuant to which all of the right, title and interest in and to 70% of the outstanding common stock of the Seller (the "Shares") will be exchanged for the right to receive 1,250,000 (one million two hundred and fifty thousand) shares of common stock of the Company (the "Exchange Shares").
Consideration for the Agreement consisted of 1,250,000 (one million two hundred and fifty thousand) shares of our common stock that were issued to Turner Wright Ltd. Company management determined the amount of consideration based upon S-X 3-05. Section 2010.2 provides as follows: A business for purposes of S-X 3-05 is identified by evaluating whether there is sufficient continuity of operations so that disclosure of prior financial information is material to an understanding of future operations. There is a presumption in S-X 11-01(d) that a separate entity, subsidiary, or division is a business. A lesser component, such as a product line, also may be considered a business. In evaluating whether a lesser component is a business, S-X 11-01(d) requires registrants to consider the following:
Will the nature of the revenue producing activity generally remain the same?

Will the nature of the revenue producing activity generally remain the same?
Will the facilities, employee base, distribution system, sales force, customer base, operating rights, production techniques, or trade names remain after the acquisition?

Will the facilities, employee base, distribution system, sales force, customer base, operating rights, production techniques, or trade names remain after the acquisition?
The Note to Section 2010.2 provides that the SEC staffs analysis of whether an acquisition constitutes the acquisition of a business, rather than of assets, focuses primarily on whether the nature of the revenue producing activity previously associated with the acquired assets will remain generally the same after the acquisition.
Turner Wright Ltd. continues to maintain its principal place of business. There is no continuity of facilities with the Company. A copy of the Share Exchange Agreement with Turner Wright Ltd. is attached as an exhibit to this current report on Form 8K.
