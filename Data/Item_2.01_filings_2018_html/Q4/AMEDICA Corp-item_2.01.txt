Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
The disclosure set forth in the Introductory Note and Item 1.01 above is incorporated into this Item 2.01 by reference.
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the aggregate purchase price for the Acquired Assets was approximately $10.0 million, comprised of (i) the assumption by CTL of the Companys payment obligations under the North Stadium Note, (ii) the issuance of the Note by CTL to the Company, and (iii) an earn-out payment of up to $1.5 million if CTL achieves certain sales revenues for the Acquired Assets over the three-year period following the Closing.
The Companys manufacture of spinal implant products that incorporate silicon nitride technology will be subject to an exclusive manufacturing arrangement described in the Purchase Agreement, which governs the Companys manufacture of such products for CTL for ten years following the Closing. Further, the Company has agreed to pay the cost, if any, to re-sterilize and re-package select silicon nitride spinal inventories sold to CTL if the sterilization date expires prior to CTL selling the inventories to a third-party customer. Following the Closing, the Company will continue to manufacture and own all rights to silicon nitride products for other non-spinal biomedical applications and to own the patents claiming the manufacture of silicon nitride products for other non-spinal biomedical applications.
In addition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, within 30 days following the Closing, the Company is required to change its name from Amedica Corporation to a name that does not include the word Amedica.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
