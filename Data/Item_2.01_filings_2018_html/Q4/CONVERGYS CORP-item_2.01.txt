Merger Consideration
As of the effective time of the Initial Merger, each outstanding Convergys option: (i) that has a per share exercise price that is less than the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to, for each Convergys common share underlying such Convergys option, the excess of (x) the cash equivalent merger consideration over (y) the applicable per share exercise price or (ii) that has a per share exercise price that is greater than or equal to the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled for no consideration.
Each Convergys restricted stock unit, performance-based restricted stock unit, and deferred stock unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Initial Merger will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment, with respect to each Convergys common share underlying such award, equal to the cash equivalent merger consideration, or, if higher, a cash amount equal to the average of the opening and closing prices of the Convergys common shares on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date. Payment for Convergys performance-based restricted stock units will be based on the greater of the number of shares that would be earned based on achievement of target performance and the number of shares determined under the applicable award agreement. The cash payment in respect of each Convergys restricted stock unit or performance-based restricted stock unit that was granted on or after March 31, 2016 (other than any such award that is held by a non-employee director or that becomes vested at the effective time of the Initial Merger pursuant to the terms of an applicable contract) will remain unvested and will continue to vest and be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. Other than as provided above, and except in the case of certain awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the cash payments will be paid promptly following the effective time of the Initial Merger, but not later than five business days following such date.
As a result of the Mergers, former Convergys shareholders will receive an aggregate of $1.2 billion in cash consideration, which was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing obtained by SYNNEX, and an aggregate of approximately 11.5 million shares of SYNNEX Common Stock for Company Common Shares, with the total share consideration valued at approximately $1.0 billion, based on the closing price of shares of SYNNEX Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) on the day prior to the Closing Date.
The description of the Mergers and the Merger Agreement set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
