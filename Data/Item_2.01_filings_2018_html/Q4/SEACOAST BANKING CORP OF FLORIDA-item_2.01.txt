Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Effective October 19, 2018, Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida, a Florida corporation (Seacoast or the Company), completed its previously announced merger (the Merger) with First Green Bancorp, Inc., a Florida corporation (First Green), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated June 11, 2018, by and among Seacoast, Seacoasts wholly-owned subsidiary, Seacoast National Bank, a national banking association (Seacoast Bank), First Green and First Greens wholly-owned subsidiary, First Green Bank, a Florida chartered bank. At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), First Green merged with and into Seacoast, with Seacoast as the surviving corporation and immediately following the Merger, First Green Bank merged with and into Seacoast Bank, with Seacoast Bank continuing as the surviving bank.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, holders of First Green common stock received 0.7324 of a share of Seacoast common stock (subject to the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of First Green common stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, outstanding First Green stock options vested in full and were immediately cancelled and the holder of such option converted into the right of the holder of such option to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the total number of shares of First Green common stock subject to such option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) $23.00 over (B) the per share exercise price for the applicable option, less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The aggregate amount paid by Seacoast for the merger consideration was approximately $115 million based on the closing price of Seacoast common stock on October 19, 2018. Each share of Seacoast common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger remained outstanding and was unaffected by the Merger.
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is included as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
