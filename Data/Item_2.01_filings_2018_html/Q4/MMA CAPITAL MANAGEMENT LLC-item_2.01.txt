TRS
) counterparty that included: i) the termination of fifteen (15) TRS agreements that had a total notional amount of $102.6 million; ii) the sale of one (1) multi-family tax-exempt bond and one (1) subordinate certificate interest in a multi-family tax-exempt bond with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (
UPB
) of $10.8 million; and iii) the termination of a pay-fixed interest rate swap that had a notional amount was $65.0 million (these transactions are collectively referred to hereinafter as the 
December Transactions
). Additionally, during the first week of January 2019, the Company expects to enter into agreements with BAC to sell one (1) multi-family tax-exempt bond and one (1) subordinate certificate interest in a multi-family tax-exempt bond with an aggregate expected UPB of $8.5 million (the

 and together with the December Transactions, the 
).
Upon the final settlement of the December Transactions, which is anticipated to be completed by December 27, 2018, the Company will receive total net payments of $14.1 million, plus accrued interest. The portion of net proceeds to be received from the December Transactions that is attributable to the Companys TRS and other bond interests reflects the realization of a 5.0% premium above the UPB of such TRS and bond interests, which was $111.0 million as of the dates on which the Company entered into each of the December Transactions.
The December Transactions were entered into, and the January Transaction is expected to be entered into, at prices that are based upon indications of fair value that, consistent with the Companys historical valuation policies, were measured based upon an assessment of expected future cash flows and market yields.
Upon final settlement of the Transactions, the termination of TRS agreements with a combined notional value of $49.5 million will be accounted for as a sale of the bonds referenced in such agreements and the repayment of asset-related debt while the termination of the balance of the TRS agreements, which had a combined notional value of $53.1 million, will be accounted for as the final net cash settlement of derivative instruments. Further, the Company will also report the conveyance of tax-exempt bonds as a sale of such investments, while the termination of the interest rate swap will result in the reduction of its carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based upon the termination payment received related to such agreement.
Based upon the foregoing, upon the final settlement of the December Transactions, the Company will: i) derecognize $53.9 million of Investments in debt securities; ii) derecognize $42.0 million of Debt, iii) derecognize $2.3 million of Other Assets; iv) derecognize $0.1 million of Other Liabilities, iv) increase Cash and cash equivalents by $14.1 million and v) reclassify $16.9 million of net holding gains on bond investments from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of Net gains on bonds, resulting in minimal net impact on common shareholders equity in consideration of the net change in the fair value of the impacted bond investments, TRS and terminated interest rate swap between September 30, 2018 and the execution dates of the December Transactions. The final settlement of the January Transaction is expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2019 in a similar manner as the December Transactions. In this regard, upon the settlement of the January Transaction, the Company expects to: i) derecognize the carrying value of the underlying bond investments associated with the January Transaction; ii) derecognize the carrying value of corresponding Debt, iii) increase Cash and cash equivalents by the amount of net proceeds received from the January Transaction and iv) reclassify the carrying value of net holding gains on the subject bond investments from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of Net gains on bonds. The January Transaction is not expected to have an impact on the Companys Other assets or Other liabilities.
