Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Effective October 5, 2018, Coastway Bancorp, Inc. ("Coastway"), a Maryland corporation, completed its previously announced merger with HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. ("HarborOne"), a Massachusetts corporation, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among HarborOne, Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC and Coastway, dated as of March 14, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement").
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Coastway's stockholders are entitled to receive, in exchange for each share of Coastway common stock that they own, $28.25 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"). Each option to purchase Coastway common stock, whether vested or unvested, automatically converted to the right to receive a cash payment equal to (i) the number of shares of Coastway common stock provided for in such option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Coastway common stock provided for in such option, which cash payment shall be made without interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes. Additionally, all Coastway restricted stock awards vested in full and were considered outstanding shares of Coastway common stock, for the purposes of receiving the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration totals approximately $125.6 million.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the mergers do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1 to Coastway's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 15, 2018.
