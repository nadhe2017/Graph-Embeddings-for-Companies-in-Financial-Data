Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On December 6, 2018, Lazydays Holdings, Inc. (Lazydays or the Company) completed its previously announced asset purchase with Tennessee RV Sales and Service, LLC (Tennessee RV or the Seller). The assets and liabilities purchased consisted primarily of inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, accounts payable, floor plan liabilities, and the certificates, permits, approvals and licenses pertaining to the dealership properties.
The total consideration paid for the net acquired assets was $24.7 million consisting of cash, the acquisition of the floor plan liabilities, and a note due to the owners of Tennessee RV (the Seller Note). The Seller Note of approximately $4.1 million accrues interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum, and in the case of an event of default, increases to 8.0% per annum until the event of default is cured. Pursuant to the terms of the Seller Note, the Company shall make monthly payments of principal and interest of approximately $0.1 million through the fourth anniversary of the Seller Note at which time all accrued principal and interest shall be due and payable. Additionally, the purchase price is subject to a final net working capital adjustment after the closing date. If the final net working capital adjustment exceeds the estimated net working capital adjustment, the Company shall pay to the Seller such excess and if the final net working capital adjustment is less than the estimated net working capital adjustment, the amount of such deficiency will be set-off against the next required payment under the Seller Note.
