Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on December 10, 2018, Merger Sub merged with and into Oclaro (the Merger), with Oclaro surviving the Merger (the time of the Merger, the Effective Time).
At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Oclaro common stock, par value $0.01 per share, other than shares owned by Lumentum, Oclaro and their subsidiaries, was automatically converted into the right to receive the following consideration (collectively, the Merger Consideration), without interest:
 $5.60 in cash (the Cash Consideration); and

$5.60 in cash (the Cash Consideration); and
 0.0636 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Lumentum common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Stock Consideration) (such ratio, the Exchange Ratio).

0.0636 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Lumentum common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Stock Consideration) (such ratio, the Exchange Ratio).
Each Oclaro restricted stock unit award (each, an Oclaro RSU) that did not become vested at the Effective Time was converted into a Lumentum restricted stock unit award (a Lumentum RSU) with the same terms and conditions, including vesting, that were applicable to such Oclaro RSU, except that the number of Lumentum shares subject to the Lumentum RSU equals the product of (i) the number of Oclaro shares subject to such Oclaro RSU (with any performance milestones deemed achieved based on the maximum level of achievement) multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the Cash Consideration by $43.189 (Lumentums average closing price for the 10 trading days ending on December 4, 2018, the third trading day prior to the Closing Date), rounded down to the nearest whole share (such sum, the Equity Award Exchange Ratio).
Each Oclaro stock option (each, an Oclaro Option), whether vested or unvested, was converted into a Lumentum stock option (a Lumentum Option) with the same terms and conditions, including vesting, that were applicable to such Oclaro Option, except that (i) the number of shares subject to the Lumentum Option equals the product of (A) the number of Oclaro shares subject to such Oclaro Option multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share and (ii) the exercise price of the Lumentum Option equals (A) the exercise price per share of the Oclaro Option divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Oclaro Option that was held by an individual who was not an Oclaro employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time was cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each net option share covered by such Oclaro Option, subject to applicable withholding taxes.
