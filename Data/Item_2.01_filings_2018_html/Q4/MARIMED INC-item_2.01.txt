Item 2.01.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Between September 10, 2018 and October 26, 2018 we purchased $12.75 million of secured convertible debentures (the GC Debentures) of GenCanna Global, Inc., a world leader in the production and distribution of agricultural hemp, cannabidiol (CBD) formulations, hemp genetics, and hemp products (GenCanna).
The GC Debentures bear interest at a compounded rate of 9% per annum and mature three years from issuance. We have been granted a senior security interest on certain assets of GenCanna equal to the value of the principal and accrued interest on the GC Debentures.
The GC Debentures are convertible into the common stock of GenCanna, at our option, upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event, as defined in the GC Debentures. The conversion price is the lesser of (i) a 20% discount to the price of the Liquidity Event, or (ii) the price based on a defined post-money valuation of GenCanna.
We have the option to purchase up to an aggregate of $30 million of GC Debentures. Conversion of the entire $30 million anticipated investment would equate to at least a 33.3% interest in GenCanna on a fully diluted basis. If a Liquidity Event does not occur on or before June 30, 2020, we have the option to have GenCanna redeem all of the GC Debentures in cash for the principal amount of the GC Debentures plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Funding for our purchase of the GC Debentures is being provided in part through our issuance of the $10M Debentures described below in Item 2.03.
