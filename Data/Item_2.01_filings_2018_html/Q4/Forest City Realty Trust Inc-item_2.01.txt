Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On the Closing Date, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub completed the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In the Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a Share and, collectively, the Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in each case not held on behalf of third parties) was converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25.35 per Share (without interest and less any applicable tax withholding) (the Merger Consideration).

Merger Consideration
At the Effective Time, each unexercised outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Companys 1994 Stock Plan (the Stock Plan), whether vested or unvested, was automatically cancelled and the former holder of such option became entitled to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of the number of Shares subject to such option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such option, less any applicable taxes. Each option with an exercise price per Share greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration was cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.
At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock award under the Stock Plan (excluding any awards subject to performance-based vesting) automatically accelerated in full and were cancelled, and the former holder of such restricted share became entitled to receive (without interest and less any applicable taxes) an amount in cash equal to the number of restricted shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration.
At the Effective Time, each outstanding performance-based stock award under the Stock Plan (each, a Performance Share), whether vested or unvested, automatically vested on a prorated basis (as described in the following sentence) and was cancelled, and each such vested Performance Share entitles the former holder thereof to receive (without interest and less any applicable taxes) an amount in cash equal to the total number of Shares subject to such Performance Share based on the higher of target performance and the actual level of performance through the Effective Time, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, multiplied by the Merger Consideration. The Performance Shares vested on a prorated basis as follows: one-third of Performance Shares granted in 2018 vested, two-thirds of Performance Shares granted in 2017 vested and 100% of Performance Shares granted in 2016 vested and, in each case, the portion of the award that did not vest was forfeited without consideration.
