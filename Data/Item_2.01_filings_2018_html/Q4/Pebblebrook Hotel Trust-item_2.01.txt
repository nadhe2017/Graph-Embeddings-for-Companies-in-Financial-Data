Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On November 30, 2018, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (Pebblebrook) completed its previously announced merger with LaSalle Hotel Properties (LaSalle) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September 6, 2018, as amended on September 18, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among Pebblebrook, Pebblebrook Hotel, L.P. (Pebblebrook OP), Ping Merger Sub, LLC (Merger Sub), Ping Merger OP, LP (Merger OP), LaSalle and LaSalle Hotel Operating Partnership, L.P. (LaSalle OP).
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on November 30, 2018, Merger OP merged with and into LaSalle OP (the Partnership Merger) with LaSalle OP surviving as a subsidiary of Pebblebrook OP. Immediately following the Partnership Merger, LaSalle merged with and into Merger Sub (the Company Merger and, together with the Partnership Merger, the Mergers) with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pebblebrook. On December 3, 2018, Merger Sub assigned all of its rights and obligations to Pebblebrook and was dissolved.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Company Merger (the Company Merger Effective Time), each common share of beneficial interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (each, a LaSalle Common Share), other than Excluded Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, was converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder, either: (i) 0.92 (the Exchange Ratio) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common shares of beneficial interest (the Common Share Consideration), $0.01 par value per share, of Pebblebrook (the Pebblebrook Common Shares) and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any; or (ii) $37.80 in cash, subject to certain adjustments and to any applicable withholding tax (the Cash Consideration and, together with the Common Share Consideration, the Merger Consideration). The maximum number of LaSalle Common Shares that were eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration was equal to 30% of the aggregate number of LaSalle Common Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook were excluded from the cash election in the Company Merger, effectively increasing the maximum number of LaSalle Common Shares that were eligible to be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration to approximately 33% of the aggregate number of LaSalle Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time. The holders of 85.8 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 77% of LaSalle Common Shares deemed outstanding for purposes of the election (including the shares held by Pebblebrook, which were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration), elected to receive the Cash Consideration. Holders of the remaining 25.4 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 23% of the LaSalle Common Shares eligible to elect the Cash Consideration, either elected to receive Pebblebrook Common Shares, did not submit valid elections, submitted an election expressing no preference or represent the approximately 10 million LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook that were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration. The LaSalle Common Shares of shareholders that validly elected to receive 100% Cash Consideration were converted into an amount in cash equal to $37.80 multiplied by (i) the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by (ii) the Cash Consideration percentage of approximately 38.9%, and an amount of Pebblebrook Common Shares equal to approximately 61.1% of the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by 0.92. The cash elections of LaSalle shareholders that validly elected a combination of the Cash Consideration and Common Share Consideration were prorated based on the above percentages subject to their individual cash/share elections.
Holders of the remaining 25.4 million LaSalle Common Shares, or approximately 23% of the LaSalle Common Shares eligible to elect the Cash Consideration, either elected to receive Pebblebrook Common Shares, did not submit valid elections, submitted an election expressing no preference
or represent the approximately 10 million LaSalle Common Shares held by Pebblebrook that were not eligible to receive the Cash Consideration. The LaSalle Common Shares of shareholders that validly elected to receive 100% Cash Consideration were converted into an amount in cash equal to $37.80 multiplied by (i) the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by (ii) the Cash Consideration percentage of approximately 38.9%, and an amount of Pebblebrook Common Shares equal to approximately 61.1% of the number of such holders LaSalle Common Shares multiplied by 0.92. The cash elections of LaSalle shareholders that validly elected a combination
of the Cash Consideration and Common Share Consideration were prorated based on the above percentages subject to their individual cash/share elections.
In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Company Merger Effective Time, each outstanding 6.375% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (the LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares) was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred shares of Pebblebrook, the 6.375% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the Series E Preferred Shares), having the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers materially unchanged from those of the LaSalle Series I Preferred Shares, and each outstanding 6.3% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, $.01 par value per share, of LaSalle (the LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares) was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred shares of Pebblebrook, the 6.3% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest, $0.01 par value per share (the Series F Preferred Shares), having the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers materially unchanged from those of the LaSalle Series J Preferred Shares.
At the effective time of the Partnership Merger (the Partnership Merger Effective Time), each common unit of LaSalle OP (a LaSalle OP Common Unit) that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, other than LaSalle OP Common Units held by LaSalle and its subsidiaries, was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 0.92 newly and validly issued common units of Pebblebrook OP, without interest.
In addition, each restricted LaSalle Common Share (the Restricted Shares) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time, including those held by LaSalle executive officers, automatically became fully vested
and all restrictions thereon lapsed, and was cancelled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Each award of performance shares with respect to LaSalle Common Shares (each, a Performance Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time automatically became earned and vested with respect to 180% of the target number of LaSalle Common Shares subject to such Performance Award agreement, and thereafter was cancelled and exchanged for the right to receive such number of earned and vested LaSalle Common Shares, which were considered outstanding as of such time, and to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such LaSalle Common Shares. Each award of deferred LaSalle Common Shares (each, a Deferred Share Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time was cancelled in exchange for the number of LaSalle Common Shares subject to such Deferred Share Award (prior to its cancellation), which LaSalle Common Shares were considered outstanding as of such time, and to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to such LaSalle Common Shares.
