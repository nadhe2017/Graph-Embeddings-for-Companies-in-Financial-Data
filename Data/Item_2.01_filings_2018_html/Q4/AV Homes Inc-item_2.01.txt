Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On the Closing Date, Taylor Morrison completed the Acquisition of AV Homes. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of AV Homes (the Target Common Shares) (excluding any shares (i) subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under an AV Homes equity plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) held by any stockholder who properly demanded and perfected (and has not effectively withdrawn or lost) his, her or its appraisal rights with respect to such shares; or (iii) owned directly by AV Homes (or any wholly owned subsidiary of AV Homes), Taylor Morrison or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time) was converted into the right to receive and become exchangeable for either (A) 0.9793 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class A common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, of Taylor Morrison (Taylor Morrison Shares), pursuant to applicable election procedures (subject to proration as described below, Stock Election Consideration); (B) $21.50 in cash, without any interest thereon, pursuant to applicable election procedures (subject to proration as described below, the Cash Election Consideration); or (C) $12.64 in cash, without any interest thereon and 0.4034 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Taylor Morrison Shares (the Mixed Election Consideration and, together with the Cash Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration, Merger Consideration). The per share Cash Election Consideration and Stock Election Consideration were subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that the aggregate Merger Consideration consisted of approximately 58.8% cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison Shares. The approximately 41.9% of AV Homes stockholders that elected to receive the Stock Election Consideration will receive 0.8908 Company Shares and $1.94 in cash, without interest thereon, in respect of each Target Common Share. The approximately 50.6% of AV Homes stockholders that elected to receive the Cash Election Consideration will receive $21.50 in cash, without interest thereon, in respect of each Target Common Share. The approximately 7.6% of AV Homes stockholders that elected or were deemed to have elected to receive the Mixed Election Consideration will receive 0.4034 Company Shares and $12.64 in cash, without interest thereon, in respect of each Target Common Share. No fractional Taylor Morrison Shares were issued in the Merger, and AV Homes stockholders received cash in lieu of any fractional shares.
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, (a) each outstanding option to purchase Target Common Shares granted under an AV Homes equity plan and (b) each restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit award in respect of Target Common Shares granted under an AV Homes equity plan (each, a Target RSU Award) that was held by a non-employee director vested (to the extent unvested) and was cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Cash Election Consideration in respect of each share of Target Common Shares underlying such award (less the applicable exercise price, in the case of such options). In addition, each (i) award of restricted Target Common Shares (Target Restricted Stock Award) and (ii) each Target RSU Award held by an employee of AV Homes or its subsidiaries was assumed by Taylor Morrison and converted into a corresponding award in respect of Taylor Morrison Shares (a Taylor Morrison Award), with the number of shares underlying each such Taylor Morrison Award equaling the product of (A) the number of Target Common Shares subject to the Target Restricted Stock Award (assuming applicable performance conditions are fully achieved) or Target RSU Award (assuming applicable performance conditions are achieved at target levels), as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Stock Election Consideration. Each such Taylor Morrison Award has the same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding Target Restricted Stock Award or Target RSU Award, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time.
