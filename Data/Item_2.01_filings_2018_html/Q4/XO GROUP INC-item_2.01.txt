Each unvested Company Stock Option and each compensatory award in respect of a Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction (Company RSA Award) that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was substituted and automatically converted into an award (a Converted Award) to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the total number of shares subject to such Company Stock Option or Company RSA Award, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) the Merger Consideration (less, in the case of Company Stock Options, the applicable exercise price). Subject to certain exceptions, such Converted Awards are subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the Company Stock Option or Company RSA Award (including vesting terms), except that any payments will be made no later than 30 days following the last day of the quarter in which the Converted Award vests.
