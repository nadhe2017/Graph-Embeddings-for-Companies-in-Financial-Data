Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On November 14, 2018, pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of July 19, 2018 (the Reorganization Agreement), by and between Spirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation (Spirit), and Comanche National Corporation, a Texas corporation (Comanche), Comanche merged with and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). Immediately after the Merger, Comanche National Corporation of Delaware, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Comanche, merged with and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the surviving corporation.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Reorganization Agreement, each outstanding share of Comanche common stock, no par value, held immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into the right to receive $30.67 in cash and approximately 5.37 shares of Spirit common stock, no par value (Spirit Common Stock). In lieu of each fractional share of Spirit Common Stock that would otherwise have been issued to Comanche shareholders in the Merger, Spirit will pay cash in an amount (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying such fraction by $21.00.
The foregoing description of the Reorganization Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Reorganization Agreement, which is incorporated by reference in this Form 8-K as Exhibit 2.1.
