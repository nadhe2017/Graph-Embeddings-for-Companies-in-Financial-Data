Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On November 28, 2018 (the Closing Date), CVS Health Corporation, a Delaware corporation (CVS Health), completed its acquisition of Aetna Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (Aetna). Pursuant to the terms of the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated as of December 3, 2017, among CVS Health, Hudson Merger Sub Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CVS Health (Merger Sub), and Aetna, Merger Sub merged with and into Aetna, with Aetna continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). As a result of the Merger, Aetna became a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of CVS Health.
At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each common share of Aetna (other than treasury shares held by Aetna and any shares beneficially owned by CVS Health or any of CVS Healths subsidiaries unless such shares were owned in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of other persons) was converted into the right to receive 0.8378 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of CVS Health (the Common Stock) and $145.00 in cash, without interest thereon (together, the Merger Consideration). No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and Aetnas former stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock.
Each outstanding Aetna equity award that was vested or that became vested pursuant to its terms as of the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or a payment in cash in an amount based on the value of the Merger Consideration less any applicable exercise price (except for restricted stock units held by Aetnas former non-employee directors, which were converted into the right to receive a payment in cash in an amount based on the closing trading price of Aetna common shares on the day prior to the Closing Date). Each outstanding Aetna equity award that was not vested as of the Effective Time or that was granted after the date of the Merger Agreement was cancelled and converted into a CVS Health equity award, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Aetna equity award immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the performance goals for performance-based awards deemed achieved at the higher of target or actual performance), except that the number of shares of Common Stock subject to each converted CVS Health equity award equals the product of the number of Aetna common shares underlying each such award at the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio of 2.729, which is the sum of 0.8378, plus the quotient of $145.00 divided by $76.686. The applicable exercise price of any converted Aetna equity award was also adjusted to take account of the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.
In connection with the Merger, CVS Health issued approximately 274.4 million shares of Common Stock and paid an aggregate of approximately $48.1 billion in cash to former Aetna shareholders in exchange for Aetna common shares and to former Aetna equity award holders in exchange for their vested equity awards, resulting in aggregate merger consideration to Aetnas former shareholders and equity award holders of approximately $70 billion, calculated based on the closing price of Common Stock on November 27, 2018.
The foregoing summary of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CVS Health with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on December 5, 2017, and is incorporated by reference herein.
The aggregate cash consideration for the Merger was financed using (i) term borrowings by CVS Health on the Closing Date of $5.0 billion consisting of the full amount of the $3.0 billion three-year tranche and the $2.0 billion five-year tranche under the term loan agreement entered into by CVS Health, the lenders party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, previously described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by CVS Health with the SEC on December 19, 2017, and (ii) net proceeds of the issuance by CVS Health of $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2020, $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2021, $2,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Senior Notes due 2020, $3,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.350% Senior Notes due 2021, $6,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.700%
