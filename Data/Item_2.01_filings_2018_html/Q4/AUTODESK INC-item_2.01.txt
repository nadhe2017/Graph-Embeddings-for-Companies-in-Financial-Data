Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Araujo Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), PlanGrid, and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the securityholders agent, Merger Sub merged with and into PlanGrid, with PlanGrid continuing as the

surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger), for a total purchase price of $875 million, net of cash, subject to customary adjustments.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock and preferred stock of PlanGrid issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time was converted into the right to receive the applicable consideration calculated as set forth in the Merger Agreement, without interest, and was automatically cancelled and retired and ceased to exist. In addition, each option to purchase shares of common stock of PlanGrid that was vested, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time and each restricted stock unit settleable for shares of common stock of PlanGrid that was vested, outstanding and unsettled immediately prior to the effective time was, as of the effective time, converted into the right to receive the applicable consideration calculated as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and was automatically cancelled and retired and ceased to exist. Each option to purchase shares of common stock of PlanGrid and each restricted stock unit settleable for shares of common stock of PlanGrid that was held by a continuing service provider and was unvested, outstanding and unexercised or unsettled immediately prior to the effective time was assumed by the Company and became an option to purchase, or a restricted stock unit settleable for, shares of common stock of the Company.
