Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
The information contained in the Introductory Note and in Item 5.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
On November 26, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, UTC completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Rockwell Collins, with Rockwell Collins continuing as the surviving entity. As a result of the Merger, Rockwell Collins became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC.
At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of Rockwell Collins common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Rockwell Collins Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for shares held by Rockwell Collins as treasury stock or held directly by UTC or Merger Sub, shares held by any wholly owned subsidiary of Rockwell Collins or any wholly owned subsidiary of UTC (other than Merger Sub)) was converted into the right to receive (i) $93.33 in cash, without interest and (ii) 0.37525 of a share of UTC common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and cash in lieu of fractional shares (together, the Merger Consideration), less any applicable withholding taxes.
Rockwell Collins Common Stock
Merger Consideration
As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Rockwell Collins stock option was canceled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each net option share subject to such option, less applicable tax withholding, with the number of net option shares calculated by subtracting from the total number of shares subject to such option a number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate applicable exercise price. As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Rockwell Collins restricted stock award, and each Rockwell Collins restricted stock unit award, whether performance-based or time-based, granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement or to a non-employee director of Rockwell Collins, became fully vested and was canceled in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Rockwell Collins Common Stock subject to such award (with the number of shares subject to any performance-based restricted stock unit award deemed to be equal to the target number of shares), less applicable tax withholding. As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Rockwell Collins restricted stock unit award, whether performance-based or time-based, granted on or after the date of the Merger Agreement was assumed by UTC and converted into a time-based restricted stock unit award of UTC with an equivalent value (as calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the Merger Agreement, and with any performance-based restricted stock unit award deemed to be achieved at target level). As of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Rockwell Collins deferred stock unit award that was payable by its terms
