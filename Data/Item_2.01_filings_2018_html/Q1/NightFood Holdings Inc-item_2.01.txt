Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On January, 19, 2018, the Registrant donated product valued at $24,883, to Rock and Wrap It Up!, a non-profit organization formed in 1990, dedicated to addressing the issues of hunger and poverty in America. The donated product was distributed to over one dozen local shelters and community centers to help them feed the hungry. The Registrant has committed to making further donations to this charitable organization which will allow them to facilitate monthly NightFood Nights as part of their providing regular meals to homeless persons. Management believes that the goodwill generated by donations such as this one of short-dated inventory to Rock and Wrap It Up! will prove beneficial to our business and our shareholders.
