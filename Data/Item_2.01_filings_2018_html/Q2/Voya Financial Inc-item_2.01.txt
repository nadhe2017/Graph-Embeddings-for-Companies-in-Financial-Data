Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On June 1, 2018 Voya Financial, Inc. a Delaware corporation (the Company), completed the sale (the Transaction) of Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, an Iowa domiciled life insurance company subsidiary of the Company (VIAC), and Directed Services LLC, an indirect broker-dealer subsidiary of the Company (DSL). VIAC and DSL were acquired by a subsidiary of VA Capital Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (VA Capital) that is an insurance holding company formed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management LLC (Apollo) and Athene Holding Ltd. (Athene). Reverence Capital Partners, L.P. and Crestview Advisors, L.L.C. are also investors in VA Capital, along with the Company, which has acquired a 9.99% equity interest in VA Capital. In addition, affiliates of the Company continue to own surplus notes issued by VIAC in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. The Transaction has resulted in the Companys disposition of substantially all of its variable annuity and fixed and fixed indexed annuity businesses and related assets.
The purchase price for VIAC and DSL consisted of DSLs net capital in excess of required regulatory capital and VIACs net surplus at closing in excess of Required Adjusted Book Value (as such term is defined in the Master Transaction Agreement pursuant to which the transaction was consummated (the MTA)), after giving effect to certain restructuring and other pre-closing transactions, including the reinsurance of the fixed and fixed indexed annuity business of VIAC to affiliates of Athene and the payment of a ceding commission by Athene therefor. The purchase price at closing was based on the Companys estimate of Required Adjusted Book Value and is subject to a post-closing adjustment mechanism set forth in the MTA.
