Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On June 19, 2018 (the Closing Date), Naked Brand Group Inc. (the Company), Bendon Limited, a New Zealand limited company (Bendon), Naked Brand Group Limited, an Australia limited company (formerly Bendon Group Holdings Limited) (Holdco), and Naked Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (Merger Sub), consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of May 25, 2017 and amended on July 26, 2017, February 21, 2018, March 19, 2018 and April 23, 2018 (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, Bendon, Holdco, Merger Sub and Bendon Investments Ltd., a New Zealand company and the owner of a majority of the outstanding shares of Bendon at the time the Merger Agreement was executed. The Merger Agreement was approved by the Companys stockholders on June 11, 2018.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (the Merger). The Merger occurred immediately after Bendon and Holdco completed a reorganization pursuant to which all of the shareholders of Bendon exchanged all of their outstanding ordinary shares of Bendon for ordinary shares of Holdco (the Reorganization and, together with the Merger, the Transactions).
At the time the Merger became effective (the Effective Time), each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share (Company Common Stock), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive 0.2 ordinary shares of Holdco, with fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share, for an aggregate of approximately 2,068,438 ordinary shares of Holdco (the Per Share Consideration). Outstanding options and warrants of the Company, by their terms, automatically entitle the holders thereof to purchase ordinary shares of the Holdco, with the number of underlying shares and exercise price proportionately adjusted to reflect the Per Share Consideration.
Immediately after giving effect to the Reorganization, Merger and the PIPE Investment (as set forth in Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01), holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and outstanding options and warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time now hold approximately 9.0% of the total capitalization of Holdco.
