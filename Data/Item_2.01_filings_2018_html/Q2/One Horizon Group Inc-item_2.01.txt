Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On May 18, 2018, we entered into and closed an Exchange Agreement pursuant to which we acquired 51% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of Banana Whale Studios Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation (Banana Whale). In exchange for the interest in Banana Whale, we agreed to issue to its current stockholders the number of shares of our common stock determined by dividing six times the net after tax earnings of Banana Whale during the twenty-four month period ending May 31, 2020, (the Measurement Period) by the average of the closing price of our common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the end of the Measurement Period (the Market Value). If Banana Whales net after tax earnings during the Measurement Period exceeds $5,655,000, we will issue to the stockholders of Banana Whale a number of additional shares of common stock equal to Banana Whales net after-tax earnings for the Measurement Period, divided by the Market Value of the common stock; provided, that if Banana Whales net after tax earnings during the Measurement Period exceeds $5,655,000 by more than 20%, we will deliver to the stockholders of Banana Whale a number of additional shares of common stock equal to two (2) times Banana Whales net after-tax earnings for the Measurement Period, divided by the Market Value of the common stock. To the extent the number of shares which we are obligated to issue to the stockholders of Banana Whale exceeds 19.99% of our outstanding shares of common stock, stockholder approval for issuance of those shares is required under applicable rules of NASDAQ.
As a condition to closing the acquisition, Banana Whales stockholders demanded and we agreed to issue to them 7,383,000 shares of our common stock as security for our obligation to issue such shares to which they may become entitled. If the number of shares to which the stockholders of Banana Whale become entitled is less than 7,383,000, the excess shares will be returned to us for cancellation.
Banana Whale is a B2B software provider in the $100+ billion-dollar gaming industry focusing on innovation and next generation games and entertainment.
