Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On June 4, 2018, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Jacksonville Bancorp, with Jacksonville Bancorp as the surviving entity (the Merger). Following the Merger, Jacksonville Bancorp was dissolved.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Jacksonville Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive $33.70 in cash (the Merger Consideration). At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Jacksonville Bancorp common stock issued by Jacksonville Bancorp was canceled and the holder received the right to receive a cash payment equal to $33.70 minus the option exercise price. Additionally, at the Effective Time, each restricted stock award issued that was outstanding at the Effective Time, vested in full and such shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Subsequent to the Merger, it is expected that Jacksonville Savings Bank, an Illinois savings bank that was wholly owned by Jacksonville Bancorp, will be merged with and into CNB Bank & Trust, N.A., an Illinois commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of CNB (CNB Bank & Trust), with CNB Bank & Trust as the surviving entity (the Bank Merger). The Bank Merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 or the first quarter of 2019.
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to Jacksonville Bancorps Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 18, 2018 and is incorporated herein by reference.
