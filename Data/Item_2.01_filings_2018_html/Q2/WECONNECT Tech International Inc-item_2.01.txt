Item 2.01 Completion of an Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On June 8, 2018, WECONNECT TECH INTERNATIONAL, INC. (we, us or the Company), executed a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with MIG Mobile Tech Berhad, a corporation organized under the laws of Malaysia (MIG), and shareholders holding up to 99.662% of the issued and outstanding securities of MIG (collectively, the MIG Shareholders). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we purchased 49,831,007 shares of MIG (the MIG Shares), representing approximately 99.662 % of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MIG. As consideration, we agreed to issue to the MIG Shareholders 498,310,070 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.05 per share, for an aggregate value of US$24,915,503.50. We consummated the acquisition of the MIG Shares on June 8, 2018. It is our understanding that the MIG Shareholders are not U.S. Persons within the meaning of Regulations S. Accordingly, the Shares are being sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation S promulgated thereunder. The foregoing description of the Share Exchange Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Share Exchange Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.
MIG Mobile Tech Berhad is a payment solution provider, providing a platform designed to consolidate users forms of payment and connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of online and offline transaction, visa-powered card, smart kiosk, reward system, and shopping aggregator system. As a result of our acquisition of the MIG Shares, we entered into the payment solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia.
Prior to the acquisition, the Company was considered as a shell company due to its nominal assets and limited operation. Upon the acquisition, MIG will comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity and its senior management will serve as the senior management of the combined entity. MIG is deemed to be the accounting acquirer for accounting purposes. The transaction will be treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company will become the historical financial statements of MIG, and the Companys assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with MIG beginning on the acquisition date. MIG was the legal acquiree but deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The Company was the legal acquirer but deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the reverse merger. The historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer (MIG). Historical stockholders equity of the accounting acquirer prior to the merger are retroactively restated (a recapitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the merger. Operations prior to the merger are those of the acquirer. After completion of the share exchange transaction, the Companys consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities, the operations and cash flow of the accounting acquirer.

We expect to focus our business in Malaysia, Indonesia and other ASEAN countries, which we believe are regions of growth due to the youthful population, increasing income level, and the maturation of e-commerce products and services in these countries. Specifically, we hope to launch our operations in Indonesia in the second quarter of 2019.

Description of the Market in Malaysia and Indonesia
Malaysia
According to a 2017 Eshopworld article, there are currently 16.53 million eCommerce users in Malaysia, with an additional 5 million users expected to be shopping online by 2021. These 20 million eCommerce users will represent approximately 77% of the total population. The average user currently spends US$74 online and is expected to will grow to US$110 by 2021.
As e-commerce continues to grow at a rapid pace in Malaysia, we believe that more and more consumers will be ready to welcome more payment options, especially going cashless through the use of mobile wallets. According to the Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes Study 2016, 74% of Malaysian surveyed prefer to make payment electronically. As the Malaysian society slowly goes cashless, we expect e-commerce platforms to introduce new and creative payment methods to meet the changing needs of consumers.
Indonesia
According to a survey report by Hootsuite, Digital in 2018, 56% of Indonesias 265.4 million people are urbanized. There were 132.7 million active internet users and 124.8 million active mobile users, with 31% of the population having made an online purchase via a desktop and 31% via mobile phone. We believe that internet and mobile purchases will account for an increasingly larger market share in the future of retail in Malaysia, Indonesia and other ASEAN countries. We also believe that the move towards cashless transactions will continue in these regions. During this period of transition, we believe that it will be important for merchants and customers to be able to conveniently and seamlessly interact from the initial contact to the ultimate purchase, including both digital and in-person interactions throughout the entire purchasing process.
Our Products and Services
Current
Scan2Pay: Our Scan2Pay program allows users to purchase products and services from brick and mortar merchants without the use of cash or a debit/credit card on hand. Participating merchants using our platform are identified by a sticker in their window. So long as the user has access to an internet connection and a camera, users will be able to purchase goods and services with their mobile telephone by scanning.
Future. We expect to introduce the following products as they become available in the future.
WPAY E-Wallet: WPAY digitalizes all the payment methods from online to offline, by using the latest digital payment technology and payment card. WPAY is designed to handle online and offline transactions. WPAY VISA Powered Cards: It is completely VISA-powered and allows users to pay by using a card enabled with a chip, magnetic strip and Pay Wave with NFC Technology to ensure acceptance around the would instantly even with legacy systems, whether through swiping, inserting or waving.
WE-Reward: WPAY is equipped with a loyalty system which has the flexibility to make redemptions through points, or combining points and cash, or even converting points to cash.
WE-Payroll: This is a multifunctional wristband operated via RFID technology which is able to very quickly speed up the entry system for an event. It collects participants data individually and enables users to associate with their social media account. Users are also able to perform cashless transactions using a RFID wristband to buy food and water during an event.
WE-Kiosk: With the implementation of a smart kiosk, users can perform cash withdrawal and deposit transactions, card issuance, and bill payments. Moving forward, users will be able to apply for financing, make a foreign currency exchange, cryptocurrency exchange, and speak to our customer satisfaction personnel.
WE-ID: This is a facial recognition system based on faceprints that can quickly and accurately identify target individuals. It also serves as the ticket entry system to identify a particular individual for all events and uses higher technology and a secure authentication method for transaction, instead of using the traditional thumbprint, password etc.
WE-Aggregator System: To reconnect with the core feature of WECONNECT, WPAY will now act as aggregator of not only the online malls, but also aggregate payments as a solution for education fees, bill and utilities payment, and later on, insurance and investments.

Operations
Our business operations are divided into the following core functions to address the needs of our merchants and customers.
Merchant Services Representatives. Once a contract is signed, one of our merchant services representatives will initiate the first of several communications with the merchant to introduce the merchant to the tools that we provide and plan for our ecosystem. Before the product goes live on the app, the representative works with the merchant to prepare staffing and inventory capacity in anticipation of increased customer traffic. The representative communicates with the merchant on the day the product is featured to review deal performance. We also offer several merchant tools to help merchants manage their products. These tools are accessible through an online account that is personal to the merchant and accessed through a mobile platform. As of April 30, 2018, we employed 12 merchant services representatives.
Customer Service Representatives. Our customer service representatives can be reached via the app or email 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The customer service team also works with our information technology team to improve the customer experience on the website and mobile applications based on customer feedback.
Technology. We employ technology to improve the experience we offer to subscribers and merchants, increase the rate at which our subscribers use our WECONNECT platform and enhance the efficiency of our business operations. A component of our strategy is to continue developing and refining our technology.
We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new technologies and features and improving our core technologies. Our information technology team is focused on the design and development of new features and products, maintenance of our websites and development and maintenance of our internal operations systems.
In addition, we use our technology and scale to target relevant products based on individual user preferences. As we increase the volume of transactions through our marketplace, we increase the amount of data that we have about deal performance and customer interests. This data allows us to continue to improve our ability to help merchants design the most effective deals and deliver deals to customers that better match their interests. Increased relevancy enables us to offer the best products, which we believe results in increasing purchases by targeted subscribers, thereby driving greater demand. We monitor the relevancy of products by measuring purchasing rates among targeted subscribers.
Merchant Scale and Quality. We draw on the experience we have gained to evaluate prospective merchants based on quality, location and relevance to our subscribers. We maintain a large base of prospective merchants interested in our marketplace, which enables us to be more selective and offer our subscribers higher quality products. Increasing our merchant base also increases the number and variety of deals that we are able to offer to consumers, which we believe drives higher user traffic, and in turn promotes greater merchant interest in offering deals through our marketplace, creating a network effect.
Brand. We believe we have built a trusted and recognizable brand by delivering a compelling value proposition to merchants and consumers. A benefit of our brand is that a substantial portion of our subscribers are acquired through word-of-mouth, which we consider sources other than from a paid-for link to our website. We believe our brand is trusted due to our dedication to our customers and our significant investment in customer satisfaction. We believe that trust in our brand is evidenced by our repeat customers and the scale of our merchant pool.
Distribution
We market our deals directly through several platforms: mobile applications, social platforms and various business partners to display and promote WEPAY deals or cross collaborations.
Mobile Applications: Consumers access our products through our mobile platform, which is available at no additional cost on the iOS and Android mobile operating systems. We launched our mobile application in August 2016 and our applications have been downloaded 53,733 times since then.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to become an essential part of everyday local commerce for consumers and merchants. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
A Single Ecosystem: We believe our WECONNECT platform is unique in the way that the platform connects businesses and consumers through technology in more than one way with just a few steps. In addition to online shopping, we also offer cashless interactions between merchants and users. Through our platform, businesses will be able to better target certain customers and consumers will be able to purchase products by using their mobile phones or walking into a store without their wallets. We believe that products offering a combination of online and brick and mortar cashless shopping interactions are currently not prevalent in our markets.
Omnipresence: We believe that our products will help offline and online businesses mitigate experimental marketing or wasting marketing dollars to find out what works for them. We believe that our platform will help businesses better target their customers by:
Increasing online and offline visibility through online user reviews of participating businesses;

Increasing online and offline visibility through online user reviews of participating businesses;
Providing key user and product performance data to allow businesses to refine their offerings and target users; and

Providing key user and product performance data to allow businesses to refine their offerings and target users; and
Increasing customer retention by offering convenient online and offline shopping experience and increased security through the use of vouchers in lieu of cash or credit cards.

Increasing customer retention by offering convenient online and offline shopping experience and increased security through the use of vouchers in lieu of cash or credit cards.
Based on this, we believe our merchants will consider the profitability of the immediate deal, potential revenue generated by repeat customers and increased brand awareness and the resulting revenue stream that brand awareness may generate over time. We believe that some merchants may view our platform as a low-cost marketing expense and may be willing to offer products with little or no immediate profitability in an effort to gain future customers and increased brand awareness.
Helping businesses adapt to the digital age: We are extremely dedicated to helping our merchants reach their full potential and gain as much exposure as possible. Technology has changed shopping and the way we spend our money so radically that many traditional businesses struggle to keep up. Owners of offline businesses will now be able to bring their products to an online market without needing to create their own platform, thanks to WECONNECT. We strive to make the platform as accessible as possible for both merchants and users because we understand that not everyone has an easy understanding of digital-age selling.
Security and convenience: Because the mode of payments reduce cash interactions, we believe that we help users mitigate fraud and security issues. All purchases and interactions are done through pre-purchased vouchers, making the entire process safer and offering our users peace-of-mind. We understand the security concerns faced by many people today and are always seeking new and innovative ways to ensure the safety of our users and merchants.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
We expect to rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our WeConnect brand and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
The laws of Malaysia and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. Initially, we expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Malaysia where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.

7
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
COMPETITION
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price and service. We compete with leading e-commerce companies such as iPay88, PayPal, MOLPay and Alibaba (which offers Alipay) which may offer substantially the same or similar product offerings as us. We also compete with businesses that focus on particular merchant categories or markets. We also compete with traditional cash payments and other popular online shopping websites and apps, and other traditional media companies that provide discounts on products and services. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
breadth of subscriber base and merchants featured;

local presence and understanding of local business trends;

ability to deliver a high volume of relevant deals to consumers;

strength and recognition of our brand.

strength and recognition of our brand.
Although we believe we compete favorably on the factors described above, we anticipate that larger, more established companies may directly compete with us as we continue to demonstrate the viability of a local one-stop payment solution provider. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, larger product and services offerings, larger customer base and greater brand recognition. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer or subscriber base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger subscriber base or to monetize that subscriber base more effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that merchant payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our market, they may become such a factor and we may be unable to compete fairly on such terms.

Risks Relating to our Business
Our ability to generate revenue to support our operations is uncertain, we have a limited operating history that you can use to evaluate us, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small developing company.
We are in the early stages of our business and have a limited history of generating revenues. We have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our potential for future success, and we are subject to the additional risks affecting early-stage businesses. Rather than relying on historical information, financial or otherwise, to evaluate our Company, you should evaluate our Company in light of your assessment of the growth potential of our business and the expenses, delays, uncertainties, and complications typically encountered by early-stage businesses, many of which will be beyond our control. Early-stage businesses in rapidly evolving markets commonly face risks, such as the following:
 uncertain revenue generation;  operational difficulties;  lack of sufficient capital;  competition from more advanced enterprises; and  unanticipated problems, delays, and expenses relating to the development and implementation of business plans.

We are not currently profitable and may not ever become profitable.
We have not yet generated any revenues from operations. We incurred a net loss of approximately $1,646,635 and $1,103,176 for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $1,116,136 and $1,175,003 for the nine months ended April 30, 2018, respectively. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future in connection with our proposed acquisitions and may never become profitable. We may experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future if we are not able to fund the expansion of our business plan through operations or additional financing. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our business. We are a development stage company with limited operating history and we face a high risk of business failure which could result in the loss of your investment.
Our limited operating history may make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our operating results and control our business expense which means we face a high risk of business failure which could result in the loss of your investment.
Our planned expense levels are, and will continue to be, based in part on our expectations, which are difficult to forecast accurately based on our stage of development and factors outside of our control. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected developments. Further, business development expenses may increase significantly as we expand operations or make acquisitions. To the extent that any unexpected expenses precede, or are not rapidly followed by, a corresponding increase in revenue, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected which could result in the loss of your investment.
We may grow our business through acquisitions in the near future, which may result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.
We expect to achieve our business plan through organic growth but may consider acquisitions and investments. We periodically evaluate an array of potential strategic transactions and may make one or more acquisitions in the near future. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:
 Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;  Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;  Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;  Retention of employees from the businesses we acquire;  Integration of the acquired companys accounting, management information, human resource, and other administrative systems;  Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;  Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties;  In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and  Failure to successfully further develop the acquired product, service or technology.

 Failure to successfully further develop the acquired product, service or technology.

Failure to successfully further develop the acquired product, service or technology.
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
Future acquisitions may also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
If we are unable to successfully manage growth, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
We expect the growth of our business and operations to place significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and operating results. Our expansion and growth in international markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements may require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.

We may need to raise additional financing to support our operations and future acquisitions, but we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us when needed. If we are unable to obtain additional financing to meet our needs, our operations may be adversely affected or terminated.
We have limited financial resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing to fund our operations in light of factors beyond our control such as the market demand for our securities, the state of financial markets, generally, and other relevant factors. Any sale of our Common Stock in the future may result in dilution to existing stockholders. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will not incur debt in the future, that we will have sufficient funds to repay any future indebtedness or that we will not default on our future debts, which would thereby jeopardize our business viability. We may not be able to borrow or raise additional capital in the future to meet our needs, which might result in the loss of some or all of your investment in our Common Stock. Even if we do raise sufficient capital and generate revenues to support our operating expenses, there can be no assurance that the revenue will be sufficient to enable us to develop our business to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations, or provide a return on investment. In addition, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, the newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders and the trading price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected. Further, if we obtain additional debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you may lose your entire investment.
Other factors can have a material adverse effect on our future profitability and financial condition.
Many other factors can affect our profitability and financial condition, including:
 changes in, or interpretations of, laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements;  changes in the rate of inflation, interest rates and the performance of investments held by us;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with;  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and, pressure from third-party interest groups;  changes in our business and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax rates and opportunities existing now or in the future;  difficulties related to our information technology systems, any of which could adversely affect business operations, including any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, or interruption of these systems;  changes in credit markets impacting our ability to obtain financing for our business operations; or  legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or technology or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, adverse litigation decisions, and issues regarding compliance with any governmental consent decree.

Risks Related to our International Operations
We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally including compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic downturns, political instability and other risks that could adversely affect our operating results.
We conduct our businesses globally and have assets located in Malaysia. We are required to comply with numerous and broad reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state and local, and foreign governmental authorities. We must also comply with other general business regulations such as those directed toward accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, handling of regulated substances, and other commercial activities, conducted by our employees and third party representatives globally. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, and civil remedies including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations may require us to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes, which could significantly increase operating costs and negatively impact operating results.

11
We operate in both developed and emerging markets which are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for our products, reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of our suppliers, customers, and other counterparties. We anticipate that emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile economic, political and market conditions. Economic downturns and volatile conditions may have a negative impact on our operating results and ability to execute its business strategies.
Our operating results may be affected by changes in trade, monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations. These conditions include but are not limited to changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, other trade barriers, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, may limit our ability to transact business in these markets and may adversely affect our revenues and operating results.
We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We will have operations, agreements with third parties and make sales in Asia, which may experience corruption. Our proposed activities in Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees, consultants, or sales agents of our Company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It will be our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. Also, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, or sales agents of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
We expect our revenues to be paid in non-U.S. currencies, and if currency exchange rates become unfavorable, we may lose some of the economic value of the revenues in U.S. dollar terms.
Our operations are conducted in Malaysia and our operating currency is the Malaysian Ringgit. Since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For instance, if currency exchange rates were to change unfavorably, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our operating income recorded in foreign currencies would be diminished.
We currently do not, but may in the future, implement hedging strategies, such as forward contracts, options, and foreign exchange swaps to mitigate this risk. There is no assurance that our efforts will successfully reduce or offset our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Additionally, hedging programs expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial results, including the following:
 We have limited experience in implementing or operating hedging programs. Hedging programs are inherently risky and we could lose money as a result of poor trades;  We may be unable to hedge currency risk for some transactions or match the accounting for the hedge with the exposure because of a high level of uncertainty or the inability to reasonably estimate our foreign exchange exposures;  We may be unable to acquire foreign exchange hedging instruments in some of the geographic areas where we do business, or, where these derivatives are available, we may not be able to acquire enough of them to fully offset our exposure;  We may determine that the cost of acquiring a foreign exchange hedging instrument outweighs the benefit we expect to derive from the derivative, in which case we would not purchase the derivative and would be exposed to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates;  To the extent we recognize a gain on a hedge transaction in one of our subsidiaries that is subject to a high statutory tax rate, and a loss on the related hedged transaction that is subject to a lower rate, our effective tax rate would be higher; and  Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could greatly increase our hedging costs.

Significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could greatly increase our hedging costs.

We anticipate increased exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as we expand the breadth and depth of our international sales.
In our financial statements, we translate our local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could result in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations.
We are susceptible to economic conditions in Malaysia where our principal business, assets, suppliers, merchants and customers are located.
Our business and assets are primarily located in Malaysia and we expect a significant portion of our customers to also be located in Malaysia. Our results of operations, financial state of affairs and future growth are, to a significant degree, subject to Malaysias economic, political and legal development and related uncertainties. Our operations and results could be materially affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
 Changes in policies by the Malaysian government resulting in changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of laws or regulations; changes in taxation,  changes in employment restrictions;  import duties, and  currency revaluation.

currency revaluation.
Because our holding company structure creates restrictions on the payment of dividends, our ability to pay dividends is limited.
We are a holding company whose primary assets are our ownership of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. We conduct no other business and, as a result, we depend entirely upon our subsidiaries earnings and cash flow. If we decide in the future to pay dividends, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries and projects may be restricted in their ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us prior to the satisfaction of other obligations, including the payment of operating expenses or debt service, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions. If future dividends are paid in the Malaysian Ringgit, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of any of these currencies into U.S. dollars may adversely affect the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars. We do not presently have any intention to declare or pay dividends in the future. You should not purchase shares of our common stock in anticipation of receiving dividends in future periods.
It may be difficult for stockholders to enforce any judgment obtained in the United States against us, which may limit the remedies otherwise available to our stockholders.
Substantially all of our assets are located in Malaysia. Moreover, our current directors and officers are nationals of Malaysia. All or a substantial portion of the assets of this person are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for our stockholders to effect service of process within the United States upon this person. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Malaysia would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or such officers and/or directors predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities law of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Malaysia against us or such persons predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.
Risks Related to our Common Stock
We can provide no assurances as to our future financial performance or the investment result of a purchase of our Common Stock.
Any projected results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainty and should be considered speculative, and depend on various assumptions which may not be correct. The future performance of our Company and the return on our common stock depends on a complex series of events that are beyond our control and that may or may not occur. Actual results for any period may or may not approximate any assumptions that are made and may differ significantly from such assumptions. We can provide no assurance or prediction as to our future profitability or to the ultimate success of an investment in our Common Stock.

Because there is no established public trading market for our common stock, you may experience difficulties in reselling your stock.
We cannot assure you that there will be an established market in the future for our common stock. The trading of securities on OTC Pink is often sporadic and investors may have difficulty buying and selling our shares or obtaining market quotations for them, which may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to sell your shares at their purchase price or at any price at all. Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling any shares you purchase from the selling security holders.
The market price of our common stock may be volatile, and our stock price may fall below your purchase price at the time you desire to sell your shares of our common stock, resulting in a loss on your investment.
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation:
 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly and annual operating results, financial condition or asset quality;  changes in general economic or business conditions, both domestically and internationally;  the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, or in laws and regulations affecting us;  the number of securities analysts covering us;  publication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;  changes in market valuations or earnings of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;  the average daily trading volume of our common stock;  future issuances of our common stock or other securities;  additions or departures of key personnel;  perceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;  significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us; and  other news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our core market or the financial services industry.

other news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our core market or the financial services industry.
The stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. In many cases, these changes have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.
Future issuances of our common stock could dilute current stockholders or adversely affect the market.
Our business plan contemplates expanding our operations through acquisitions which may involve significant issuances of our common stock. Future issuances of our common stock may be at values substantially below the price paid by the current holders of our common stock. In addition, common stock could be issued to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or even just the prospect of such sales, could depress the prevailing price of our common stock and our ability to raise equity capital in the future. Additionally, large share issuances would generally have a negative impact on our share price. It is possible that, due to additional share issuance, you could lose a substantial amount, or all, of your investment. In addition, if a trading market develops for our common stock, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material.
We will be subject to the penny stock rules which will adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.
.
In the event that our shares are traded, and our stock trades below $5.00 per share, our stock would be known as a penny stock, which is subject to various regulations involving disclosures to be given to you prior to the purchase of any penny stock. The U.S. SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Depending on market fluctuations, our common stock could be considered to be a penny stock. A penny stock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell these securities to persons other than established members and accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these securities. In addition, he must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. He must also provide certain written disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our securities, and may negatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our common stock to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks are low priced securities that do not have a very high trading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to. These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to solicit purchases of our Common Stock and therefore reduce the liquidity of the public market for our shares should one develop.
14
14
The market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses that could adversely impact investors in our stock.
Company management believes that the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:
 Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;  Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;  "Boiler room" practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by sales persons;  Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and  Wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses.

It is not likely that we will pay dividends on the Common Stock or any other class of stock.
We intend to retain any future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock, or any other class of stock, in the foreseeable future. Stockholders should look solely to appreciation in the market price of our common shares to obtain a return on investment.
Investing in our Company is highly speculative and could result in the entire loss of your investment.
An investment in our shares is highly speculative and involves significant risk. Our shares should not be purchased by any person who cannot afford to lose their entire investment. Our business objectives are also speculative, and it is possible that we would be unable to accomplish them. Our shareholders may be unable to realize a substantial or any return on their purchase of the offered shares and may lose their entire investment. For this reason, each prospective purchaser of the offered shares should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney, business and/or investment advisor.
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION
This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the MIG for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2018, and 2017, and the fiscal years ended July 31, 2017, and 2016. The discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and our financial statements and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Except for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Companys control. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.
Overview
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 25, 2007, as an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. Immediately prior to our acquisition of MIG Mobile Tech Berhad, we were a shell company with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company. We changed our name from Contact Minerals Corp. to WECONNECT Tech Internqtional, Inc. effective November 6, 2017. Our business office is located at 1st Floor, Block A, Axis Business Campus, No. 13A & 13B, Jalan 225, Seksyen 51A, 46100 Petaling Jaya, Selangor D.E., Malaysia.
Effective August 29, 2017, Contact Minerals Corp.

Mobile Business
As a result of our acquisition of the MIG Shares, we entered into the payment solution business with a focus on users located in Malaysia. MIG was incorporated and registered as a private limited company in the Malaysia on Oct 1, 2015. MIG has developed and operates a mobile platform designed to consolidate users cash and connect merchants to consumers by offering a cashless form of transaction, in-app shopping and a user rewards system. MIG currently operates in Malaysia with plans to expand to Indonesia by second quarter of 2019.
Financial Condition
During the twelve-month period following the date of this annual report, we anticipate that we will not generate sufficient operating revenue. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to pursue our plan of operations during and beyond the next twelve months. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans. However, we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or shareholder loans to establish our new business.

Net Revenue. We generated negative revenues of $504 during the three month period ended April 30, 2018, due to the reversal of revenues in the previous quarter.

Gross Loss. We achieved a gross profit of $13,293 and a gross loss of $155,874 for the three months period ended April 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The decrease in gross loss is primarily attributable to the reduction of marketing and promotional expenses.

We have never paid dividends on our Common Stock. Our present policy is to apply cash to investments in product development, acquisitions or expansion; consequently, we do not expect to pay dividends on Common Stock in the foreseeable future.
The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon the availability of additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to management as we are not generating revenues from our business operations. Our sources of capital in the past have included the sale of equity securities, which include common stock sold in private transactions and public offerings, capital leases and long-term debt. There can be no assurance that we can raise such additional capital resources on satisfactory terms. We believe that our current cash and other sources of liquidity discussed above are adequate to support operations for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares and shareholder loans in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our plan of operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our financial statements.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets represented the computer software in Malaysia which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of ten years.
The Company follows ASC Topic 350 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets carrying amounts.
Recent accounting pronouncements

Recent accounting pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements can be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
PROPERTIES

Board Committees
Effective September 22, 2017, we formed an Audit Committee which is comprised of our independent director: Pui Hold Ho and Mun Wai Wong. A copy of the charter for our Audit Committee is filed as Exhibit 99.1. Pui Hold Ho currently serves as the Audit Committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
We have not formed separate Corporate Governance and Compensation and Nominations committees. Our entire Board performs the functions of the Corporate Governance and Compensation and Nominations committees.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide us with copies of those filings. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, and up to the date of this current report, our officers, directors and greater than 10% percent beneficial owners timely filed all reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act.
Code of Ethics
We adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our officers and directors, which is a code of ethics as defined by applicable rules of the SEC. Our Code of Ethics was attached as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2008. If we make any amendments to our Code of Ethics other than technical, administrative, or other non-substantive amendments, or grant any waivers, including implicit waivers, from a provision of our Code of Ethics to our officers or directors, we will disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver, its effective date and to whom it applies in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.
Board Meetings
Prior to the change in control on September 11, 2017, our board of directors consisted solely of Kerry McCullagh, Alex Langer and William McCullagh. Our board of directors currently consists of Shiong Han Wee, Kwueh Lim Wong, Pui Hold Ho and Mun Wai Wong. The board held no formal meetings during the year ended July 31, 2017, but took actions via unanimous written consent. We expect our current board to act by written consent or through board meetings in accordance with the provisions of the Nevada General Corporate Law and our Bylaws.

Nomination Process
As of June 1, 2018, we did not effect any material changes to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our companys requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the cover of this annual report.
Corporate Governance & Board Independence; Canadian National Instrument 58-101
We are a reporting issuer in the Province of British Columbia. National Instrument 58-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators requires our company to disclose annually on our Annual Report certain information concerning corporate governance.
Our Board of Directors consists of four directors: Shiong Han Wee, Kwueh Lim Wong, Pui Hold Ho and Mun Wai Wong. We established an audit committee which is comprised of our independent director: Pui Hold Ho. Mr. Ho is also independent, as that term is described in National Instrument 52-110, and each qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as such term is defined under 17 CFR 229.407(d)(5).
We have not yet established Nominating or Governance Committees as standing committees but expect to do so as our business matures. The Board does not have an executive committee or any committees performing a similar function. We are not currently listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. All functions of a nominating/governance committee were performed by our whole board of directors. Our board of directors intends to appoint such persons and form such committees as are required to meet the corporate governance requirements imposed by the national securities exchanges as necessary. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees at the early stage of the companys development, and our board of directors believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by the members of our board of directors.
Board Leadership Structure and the Boards Role in Risk Oversight.
The Board of Directors is led by the Chairman who is also the Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that the most effective leadership structure at this time is not to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. A combined structure provides the Company with a single leader who represents the company to our stockholders, regulators, business partners and other stakeholders, among other reasons set forth below. Should the Board conclude otherwise, the Board will separate the roles and appoint an independent Chairman.
 This structure creates efficiency in the preparation of the meeting agendas and related Board materials as the Companys Chief Executive Officer works directly with those individuals preparing the necessary Board materials and is more connected to the overall daily operations of the Company. Agendas are also prepared with the permitted input of the full Board of Directors allowing for any concerns or risks of any individual director to be discussed as deemed appropriate. The Board believes that the Company has benefited from this structure, and Mr. Wees continuation in the combined role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the stockholders.  The Company believes that the combined structure is necessary and allows for efficient and effective oversight, given the Companys relatively small size, its corporate strategy and focus.

The Board of Directors does not have a specific role in risk oversight of the Company. The Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and employees of the Company provide the Board of Directors with information regarding the Companys risks.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims, lawsuits, and disputes with third parties, actions involving allegations of discrimination or breach of contract actions incidental to the normal operations of the business. We may be named as a defendant in such lawsuits and thus become subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards. We believe that we have adequate liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not be sued, that any such lawsuit will not exceed our insurance coverage, or that we will be able to maintain such coverage at acceptable costs and on favorable terms.
25
25
We are not a party to, nor is any of our property the subject of, any legal proceedings. There are no proceedings pending in which any of our officers, directors or 5% shareholders are adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or in which they are taking a position or have a material interest that is adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Currently, our executive directors and officers do not receive compensation for services in such capacities. We expect to establish a compensation plan as our company matures. We expect that our executive compensation philosophy will be to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive compensation program will be designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executives career with us. The compensation program objectives will be to attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. We expect the compensation package of our named executive officers to consist of two main elements:
1. base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and
1.
base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and
2. discretionary bonus awards payable in cash and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives.
2.
discretionary bonus awards payable in cash and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives.
Process for Setting Executive Compensation
As we do not have Compensation Committee, our Board will be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. The Board or Compensation Committee will annually review and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the executives compensation. The Board or Compensation Committee may award discretionary bonuses to each of the named executives, and reviews and approves the process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures) used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, the Board or Compensation Committee will review and approve the base salary, equity-incentive awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers.
We expect out Chief Executive Officer to periodically provide the Board or Compensation Committee with an evaluation of each named executive officers performance, based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors. The Board of Compensation Committee will provide an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations will serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives.
Our Compensation Peer Group
We expect to engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels.
Program Components
We expect our executive compensation program to consist of the following elements:
Base Salary
Our base salary structure will be designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer will reflect our past and current operating profits, the named executive officers individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board/Compensation Committee will consider all of these factors, though it will not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board/Compensation Committee will generally review the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis. For each of our named executive officers, we expect to review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market.
26
26
Discretionary Bonus
The objectives of our bonus awards will be to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our success by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that success.
Each of our named executive officers will be eligible for consideration for a discretionary cash bonus. The Chief Executive Officer will make recommendations regarding bonus awards for the named executive officers and the Board/Compensation Committee provides the bonus recommendation for the Chief Executive Officer. However, the Board/Compensation Committee will have sole and final authority and discretion in designating to whom awards are made, the size of the award, if any, and its terms and conditions. The bonus recommendation for each of the named executive officers depends on a number of factors, including (i) the performance of the Company for the year, (ii) the satisfaction of certain individual and corporate performance measures, and (iii) other factors which the Board/Compensation Committee may deem relevant. The Company did not award any cash bonuses during fiscal year 2017.
Stock Holdings
The Board/Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of having a portion of the named executive officers compensation be paid in the form of equity, to help align the executives interests with the interests of the Companys stockholders. Initially, we expect the Board/Compensation Committee to emphasize the cash-based portion of our compensation program over a stock program because it believes the discretionary nature of the cash-based compensation gives it the needed flexibility to factor in and reward the attainment of longer-term goals for the Company and the executives, as the Board/Compensation Committee deems appropriate.
We have not timed nor do we plan to time our release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
Summary Compensation Table
The following tables set forth, for each of the last two completed fiscal years of the Company, the total compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to any person who was a principal executive officer during the preceding fiscal year and every other highest compensated executive officers earning more than $100,000 during the last fiscal year (together, the Named Executive Officers).

Compensation Risk Management
Our Board of directors and human resources staff conducted an assessment of potential risks that may arise from our compensation programs. Based on this assessment, we concluded that our policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to have material adverse effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash bonuses for punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations (with modifications to comply with local regulations as appropriate). The risk-mitigating factors considered in this assessment included:
 the alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amounts relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and

the alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amounts relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and
 effective balance of cash, short- and long-term performance periods, caps on performance-based award schedules and financial metrics with individual factors and Board and management discretion.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
We have not yet established a Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors performs the functions that would be performed by a compensation committee.
Our Bylaws provide that our board of directors must consist of between one (1) and fifteen (15) directors, and such number of directors within this range may be determined from time to time by resolution of our board of directors or our stockholders. Currently, we have seven (7) directors. Our Bylaws may be amended, altered or repealed by our Board of Directors.
Our Bylaws also provide that our directors may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. An election of our directors by our stockholders will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election.
Our current and future executive officers and significant employees serve at the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may also choose to form certain committees, such as a compensation and an audit committee.
Compensation Committee Report
Our Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this report with management.

For the nine months ended April 3, 2018, MIG Network and Consultancy Sdn. Bhd. accounted for 77% our revenues. During that same period, MIG Network and Consultancy Sdn. Bhd. also accounted for 12% of our operating costs, or approximately $142,175, with accounts payable of $60,065. MIG Network and Consultancy Sdn. Bhd. is owned by our executive officers and directors, Shiong Han Wee and Kwueh Lim Wong. Messrs. Wee and Wong also serve as directors of MIG Network and Consultancy Sdn. Bhd.
As of July 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company was indebted to a relative of the President of the Company for $80 (CDN$100) and $76 (CDN$100), respectively, for expenses incurred on behalf of the Company.

McCullagh, our former President, which have been included in the statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.
Director Independence
Our board of directors is currently composed of three members, two of whom do not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are not a party to any legal or administrative proceedings that we believe, individually or in the aggregate, would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We may from time to time become a party to various legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. There are no pending legal proceedings in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
The following is a description of the material provisions of our capital stock, as well as other material terms of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws. We refer you to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this report.
Common Stock
We are authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Nevada law, to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a nominal par value of $0.001.
Dividend Rights
Subject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only then at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine.
Voting Rights
Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Under our articles of incorporation, stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes for the election of directors.
No Preemptive or Similar Rights
Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.
Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions
Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.
Preferred Stock
We are authorized to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a nominal par value of $0.001. We may amend our Amended Articles of Incorporation in the future to allow our board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.
Options
As of the date of this Report, we had no outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock.

Transfer Agent and Registrar
Our transfer agent is Empire Stock Transfer, Inc. located 1859 Whitney Mesa Drive, Henderson, Nevada 89014, telephone number is (702) 818-5898.
Anti-takeover Provisions
Some of the provisions of Nevada law, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company or removing our incumbent officers and directors. These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection against an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging such proposals. Among other things, negotiation of such proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.
Our Amended Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws provide that:
 our stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors; and  we will indemnify directors and officers against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures.

our stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors; and
 we will indemnify directors and officers against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures.

we will indemnify directors and officers against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures.
We may also adopt provisions in the future that will allow:
our board of directors to designate the terms of, and issue a new series of preferred stock with, voting or other rights without stockholder approval; and or

our board of directors to designate the terms of, and issue a new series of preferred stock with, voting or other rights without stockholder approval; and or
a majority of the authorized number of directors to generally have the power to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws without stockholder approval.

a majority of the authorized number of directors to generally have the power to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws without stockholder approval.
These provisions of our Amended Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person or entity from acquiring control of us.
NRS Sections 78.411 to 78.444 inclusive apply to combinations between resident domestic corporations (defined as a Nevada domestic corporation that has 200 or more stockholders of record) and certain affiliated stockholders (collectively, the Interested Shareholder Combination Statutes). The amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to elect not to be governed by the Interested Shareholder Combination Statutes will not have any immediate effect on the rights of existing stockholders. To the extent that we qualify as a resident domestic corporation in the future, the Board will be able to enter into acquisitions and combinations with entities affiliated with its executive officer, directors and control shareholders with greater ease, including without limitation, without the requirement of obtaining the approval of the stockholders in certain instances.
Anti-Takeover Provisions of the NRS
The Nevada Interested Shareholder Combination Statutes generally prohibit a Nevada corporation, with shares registered under section 12 of the Exchange Act and with 200 or more stockholders of record, from engaging in a combination (defined in the statute to include a variety of transactions, including mergers, asset sales, issuance of stock and other actions resulting in a financial benefit to the Interested Stockholder) with an Interested Stockholder (defined in the statute generally as a person that is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares), for a period of three years following the date that such person became an Interested Stockholder unless the board of directors of the corporation first approved either the combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder's becoming an Interested Stockholder. If this approval is not obtained, the combination may be consummated after the three year period expires if either (a) (1) the board of directors of the corporation approved the combination or the purchase of the shares by the Interested Stockholder before the date that the person became an Interested Stockholder, (2) the transaction by which the person became an Interested Stockholder was approved by the board of directors of the corporation before the person became an interested stockholder, or (3) the combination is approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of voting power not beneficially owned by the Interested Stockholder at a meeting called no earlier than three years after the date the Interested Stockholder became such; or (b) the aggregate amount of cash and the market value of consideration other than cash to be received by all holders of common stock and holders of any other class or series of shares not beneficially owned by an Interested Stockholder meets the minimum requirements set forth in NRS Sections 78.441 through 78.444.
A Nevada corporation may adopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation expressly electing not to be governed by these provisions of the NRS, if such amendment is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested shares entitled to vote; provided, however, such vote by disinterested stockholders is not required to the extent the Nevada corporation is not subject to such provisions. Such an amendment to the articles of incorporation does not become effective until 18 months after the vote of the disinterested stockholders and does not apply to any combination with an Interested Stockholder whose date of acquiring shares is on or before the effective date of the amendment.
33
33
The NRS also limits the acquisition of a controlling interest in a Nevada corporation with 200 or more stockholders of record, at least 100 of who have Nevada addresses appearing on the stock ledger of the corporation, and that does business in Nevada directly or through an affiliated corporation. According to the NRS, an acquiring person who acquires a controlling interest in an issuing corporation may not exercise voting rights on any control shares unless such voting rights are conferred by a majority vote of the disinterested stockholders of the issuing corporation at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders. In the event that the control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person acquires control shares with a majority or more of all the voting power, any stockholder, other than the acquiring person, who does not vote in favor of authorizing voting rights for the control shares is entitled to demand payment for the fair value of such person's shares.
Under the NRS, a controlling interest means the ownership of outstanding voting shares of an issuing corporation sufficient to enable the acquiring person, individually or in association with others, directly or indirectly, to exercise (1) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (3) a majority or more of the voting power of the issuing corporation in the election of directors. Outstanding voting shares of an issuing corporation that an acquiring person acquires or offers to acquire in an acquisition and acquires within 90 days immediately preceding the date when the acquiring person became an acquiring person are referred to as control shares.
The control share provisions of the NRS do not apply if the corporation opts-out of such provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation in effect on the tenth day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by an acquiring person.
These statutes do not currently apply to us and we have opted out of the business combination or acquisition of a controlling interest statutes.
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
Subsection 7 of Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (the "Nevada Law") provides that, subject to certain very limited statutory exceptions, a director or officer is not individually liable to the corporation or its stockholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer, unless it is proven that the act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and such breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. The statutory standard of liability established by Section 78.138 controls even if there is a provision in the corporation's articles of incorporation unless a provision in the Company's Articles of Incorporation provides for greater individual liability.
Subsection 1 of Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Law empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (any such person, a "Covered Person"), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Covered Person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the Covered Person is not liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Nevada Law or the Covered Person acted in good faith and in a manner the Covered Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe the Covered Person's conduct was unlawful.
Subsection 2 of Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Law empowers a corporation to indemnify any Covered Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person acted in the capacity of a Covered Person against expenses, including amounts paid in settlement and attorneys' fees actually and reasonably incurred by the Covered Person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, if the Covered Person is not liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the Nevada Law or the Covered Person acted in good faith and in a manner the Covered Person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. However, no indemnification may be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the Covered Person shall have been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction (after exhaustion of all appeals) to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought or other court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that in view of all the circumstances the Covered Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court deems proper.

Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Law further provides that to the extent a Covered Person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsection 1 or 2, as described above, or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the corporation shall indemnify the Covered Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the Covered Person in connection with the defense.
Subsection 1 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Law provides that any discretionary indemnification pursuant to Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Law, unless ordered by a court or advanced pursuant to Subsection 2 of Section 78.751, may be made by a corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Covered Person is proper in the circumstances. Such determination must be made (a) by the stockholders, (b) by the board of directors of the corporation by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding, (c) if a majority vote of a quorum of such non-party directors so orders, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of such non-party directors cannot be obtained.
Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Law provides that a corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws or an agreement made by the corporation may require the corporation to pay as incurred and in advance of the final disposition of a criminal or civil action, suit or proceeding, the expenses of officers and directors in defending such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation. Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 further provides that its provisions do not affect any rights to advancement of expenses to which corporate personnel other than officers and directors may be entitled under contract or otherwise by law.
Subsection 3 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Law provides that indemnification pursuant to Section 78.7502 of the Nevada Law and advancement of expenses authorized in or ordered by a court pursuant to Section 78.751 does not exclude any other rights to which the Covered Person may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, for either an action in his or her official capacity or in another capacity while holding his or her office. However, indemnification, unless ordered by a court pursuant to Section 78.7502 or for the advancement of expenses under Subsection 2 of Section 78.751 of the Nevada Law, may not be made to or on behalf of any director or officer of the corporation if a final adjudication establishes that his or her acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law and were material to the cause of action. Additionally, the scope of such indemnification and advancement of expenses shall continue for a Covered Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Section 78.752 of the Nevada Law empowers a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of a Covered Person for any liability asserted against such person and liabilities and expenses incurred by such person in his or her capacity as a Covered Person or arising out of such person's status as a Covered Person whether or not the corporation has the authority to indemnify such person against such liability and expenses.
Our Amended and Restated Articles provide that the liability of our directors and officers shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada Law. In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws also provide that we will indemnify our directors and may indemnify our other officers and employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our Bylaws provide that the expenses of directors and officers of the Company incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, must be paid by the Company as they are incurred and in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.
This limitation of liability does not apply to liabilities arising under the federal securities laws and does not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Company under Nevada law or otherwise, the Company has been advised that the opinion of the SEC is that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
We expect to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers pursuant to whom we will agree to indemnify each director and officer for any liability he or she may incur by reason of the fact that he or she serves as our director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MIG Mobile Tech Bhd.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MIG Mobile Tech Bhd. (the Company) as of July 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows and changes in stockholders deficit for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred continuous losses and has a capital deficit, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

2.GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY
2.
GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
For the year ended July 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $1,642,781 and working capital deficit of $939,841 as of July 31, 2017. The Company had total stockholders deficit of $820,162 as of July 31, 2017 from recurring losses and significant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its stockholders or other capital sources. Management believes that the continuing financial support from the existing shareholders or external debt financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Companys obligations as they become due.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

Income tax expense

Income tax expense
Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclosed in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.
The Company conducts major businesses in Malaysia and is subject to tax in their own jurisdictions. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file separate tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authorities.
Foreign currencies translation

Foreign currencies translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.
The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (US$) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (MYR or RM), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.
In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Translation of amounts from the local currency of the Company into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective years:
As of and for the year ended July 31, 2017 2016 Year-end MYR : US$1 exchange rate 4.2790 4.0535 Yearly average MYR : US$1 exchange rate 4.3119 4.1528

Fair value of financial instruments

Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables, amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
 Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
 Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
 Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions
Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions
As of July 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.
Recent accounting pronouncements

Recent accounting pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) - Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the threshold for reporting discontinued operations and adds new disclosures. The new guidance defines a discontinued operation as a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. The standard is required to be adopted by public business entities in annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those annual periods. Entities may early adopt the guidance for new disposals. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" which clarifies and improves the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that among other things, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices and provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of this guidance on its revenue recognition.

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. In August
2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year public entities) and interim periods therein. Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organizations management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. All other types of entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on its financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) A lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating this ASU and has not determined the effect of this standard on its ongoing financial reporting.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements upon adoption.

Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.
In the opinion of management, the balance sheet as of July 31, 2017 which has been derived from the audited financial statements and these unaudited condensed financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented.

NOTE 3  GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY

Use of estimates

Use of estimates
In preparing these financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
Trade receivables

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established and determined based on managements assessment of known requirements, aging of receivables, payment history, the customers current credit worthiness and the economic environment. The Company considers the allowance for doubtful accounts for any estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. For the receivables that are past due or not being paid according to payment terms, the appropriate actions are taken to exhaust all means of collection, including seeking legal resolution in a court of law. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment
Property and plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational:
Categories Expected useful life Computer hardware 4 years Computer software 4 years Furniture & fittings 10 years Office equipment 5 years Telecommunication 2 years Renovation 10 years Signboard 5 years Security & alarm system 4 years

Expenditure for maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the statement of operations.
Intangible assets

Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets represented the computer software in Malaysia which is amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of ten years.
The Company follows ASC Topic 350 in accounting for intangible assets, which requires impairment losses to be recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the assets carrying amounts. There was no impairment losses recorded on intangible assets for the period ended April 30, 2018.

Inventories

Inventories
Inventories consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues in the Condensed Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.

Comprehensive income

Comprehensive income
ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as presented in the accompanying statements of stockholders equity consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation and cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments held at the balance sheet date. This comprehensive income is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.
Income tax expense

Income tax expense
Income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.

Foreign currencies translation

Foreign currencies translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.
The functional currency of the Company is the United States Dollars (US$) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$. In addition, the Company maintains its books and record in a local currency, Malaysian Ringgit (MYR or RM), which is functional currency as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates.
In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.

Fair value of financial instruments

Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, trade receivable, deposits and other receivables, amount due to related parties and other payables approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820-10"), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
 Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 1 : Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
 Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 2 : Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
 Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions
Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions
For the nine months ended April 30, 2018 & 2017 the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, at least annually, on a recurring basis, nor did the Company have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Recent accounting pronouncements

Recent accounting pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) - Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the threshold for reporting discontinued operations and adds new disclosures. The new guidance defines a discontinued operation as a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. The standard is required to be adopted by public business entities in annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those annual periods. Entities may early adopt the guidance for new disposals. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" which clarifies and improves the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that among other things, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices and provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of this guidance on its revenue recognition.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going concern (Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organizations management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. All other types of entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update to defer by one year the effective dates of its new revenue recognition standard until annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (2018 for calendar-year public entities) and interim periods therein. Management is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 and has not determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02 "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on its financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on its financial statements.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: 1) A lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and 2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. The Company is evaluating this ASU and has not determined the effect of this standard on its ongoing financial reporting.
Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements upon adoption.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF APRIL 30, 2018
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF APRIL 30, 2018
NOTE 1  BACKGROUND OF ORGANISATION
On June 8, 2018, WECONNECT TECH INTERNATIONAL, INC (the Company or WCTI, and MIG Mobile Tech Bhd (MIG), consummated a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement). In connection with the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company issued 498,310,070 shares of its Common Stock at $0.05 per share in acquiring 99.662% in the equity shares of MIG.
NOTE 2  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Due to the control of WCTI and MIG, the acquisition of MIG represented a transaction among entities under common control. Pursuant to ASC 805-50-25, Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control and other SEC, the acquisition of MIG was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control and the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of MIG were carried over to and combined with WCTI at their carrying values, and as if the transaction occurred at the beginning of the period.
Although the Company is the legal acquirer, MIG was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes as a common director obtained control of MIG, prior to obtaining control of the Company on June 8, 2018. MIG will comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity and its senior management will serve as the senior management of the combined entity. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of MIG will become the historical financial statements of MIG, and WCTIs assets, liabilities and results of operations will be with MIG beginning on the acquisition date. These pro forma financial statements are presented as a continuation of MIG.
The pro forma balance sheet as of April 30, 2018 is based on the historical financial statements of WCTI after giving effect to MIGs acquisition of WCTI as a transaction among entities under common control and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the notes to the pro forma financial statements as if such acquisition had occurred as of April 30, 2018 for the balance sheet for pro forma financial statements purposes.
The pro forma financial statements have been prepared by management for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations in future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on the preliminary information available at the time of the preparation of this document and assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The pro forma financial statements, including the notes thereto, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with MIGs historical financial statements included elsewhere in this Amendment to the Current Statement on Form 8-K for the years ended July 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the period ended April 30, 2018 as Exhibits filed with SEC herewith.
The pro forma financial statements do not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial position of the combined entity would actually have been if the merger had in fact occurred on April 30, 2018, nor do they purport to project the results of operations or financial position of the combined entity for any future period or as of any date.
These pro forma financial statements do not give effect to any restructuring costs or to any potential cost savings or other operating efficiencies that could result from the merger between MIG and WCTI since such amounts, if any, are not presently determinable.
NOTE 3  PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
The pro forma financial statements have been prepared as if the acquisition was completed on April 30, 2018 for combined balance sheet purpose and reflects the following pro forma adjustment(s):
(a)To reflect the issuance of 498,310,070 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share of WCTI for the acquisition of 99.662% of MIG outstanding capital stock
(a)
To reflect the issuance of 498,310,070 shares of common stock at $0.05 per share of WCTI for the acquisition of 99.662% of MIG outstanding capital stock
(b)To eliminate the paid-in capital of MIG and account for non-controlling interest.

The reports of Manning on the Companys financial statements as of and for the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 contained explanatory paragraphs which noted that there was substantial doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern as the Company has not generated any revenues and has incurred operating losses since inception, which raised doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 and through September 15, 2017, the Company has not had any disagreements with Manning on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Mannings satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the Companys financial statements for such periods.
During the years ended July 31, 2016 and 2015 and through September 15, 2017, there were no reportable events, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
A copy of Mannings agreement with the foregoing statements was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 19, 2017.
Concurrently therewith, we retained the firm of KCCW Accountancy Corp. (KCCW), to audit our consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2017.

Concurrently therewith, we retained the firm of Total Asia Associates PLT (Total Asia), to audit our financial statements for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2018.
In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, there were no disagreements with KCCW on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope of procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KCCW, would have caused them to make reference in connection with its reports to the subject matter of the disagreements. None of the reportable events described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K of the SECs rules and regulations have occurred during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017, or during any subsequent interim period.
The audit reports of KCCW on our financial statements as of and for the year ended July 31, 2017, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except that each of the audit report for the year ended July 31, 2017, contained explanatory paragraphs regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
We have requested that KCCW furnish us with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of this letter was included as Exhibit 16.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2018.
