Anaren
Acquisition
The consideration paid by the Company was approximately $775.0 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and certain other adjustments (the Purchase Price). On the Closing Date, a portion of the Purchase Price was used to repay in full Anarens outstanding debt, with the remaining portion of the Purchase Price paid to Seller (less certain amounts paid for certain transaction expenses and to be held in escrow for the fulfillment of a post-closing purchase price adjustment, if any). The Company used a combination of cash on hand and the $600 million of borrowings under the Incremental Facility to fund the Purchase Price and pay fees and expenses related to the Acquisition.
The foregoing description of the Acquisition does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Stock Purchase Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 4, 2017, and which is incorporated herein by reference.
