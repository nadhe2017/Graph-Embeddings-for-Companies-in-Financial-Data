Item 2.01.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On April 12, 2018 RL Bend, LLC completed the sale of the Red Lion Inn and Suites Bend, in Bend, Oregon, to Third Street Ventures LLC, an Oregon limited liability company (the Purchaser). The purchase price for the hotel was $5.5 million, which was paid in cash at closing.
At closing, the Purchaser entered into a franchise agreement with Red Lion Hotels Franchising, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Lion Hotels Corporation. The franchise agreement contemplates that the franchisee will initially continue to operate the hotel under the Red Lion Inn and Suites brand, but allows for the conversion of the hotel to the Signature Inn brand. The franchise agreement provides for a 20 year term and the payment of monthly royalty and program fees equal to a percentage of the hotels gross room revenue under the Red Lion brand, and a flat monthly per room fee under the Signature Inn brand. The franchisee may terminate the franchise agreement without penalty on June 1, 2021 or June 1, 2031 providing at least 90 days notice of termination. Red Lion Hotels Franchising may terminate the franchise agreement without cause annually by providing notice to the franchisee of termination no later than March 3 of each year. Termination of the franchise agreement by Red Lion Franchising upon default of the franchisee, or termination of the agreement by the franchisee without cause, will require the franchisee to pay a termination fee.
RL Bend, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of RL Venture, LLC. RL Venture, LLC is a variable interest entity in which Red Lion Hotels Corporation holds a 55% interest, and therefore the registrant consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations of this entity.
