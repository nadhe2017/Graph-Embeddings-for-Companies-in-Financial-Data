Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On June 11, 2018, the Company completed the previously announced sale of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Kratos Public Safety & Security Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (PSS), to Securitas Electronic Security, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Buyer), pursuant to the terms of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated February 28, 2018, by and among the Company, PSS and Buyer, for a purchase price of $69 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment (the Transaction). The Company expects to receive approximately $70 million of net cash proceeds from the Transaction, after taking into account amounts to be paid by the Company pursuant to a negotiated transition services agreement between the Company and Buyer, receipt by the Company of approximately $7 million in net working capital to be retained by the Company, and associated transaction fees and expenses.
The Company's use of proceeds from the Transaction will be controlled by the Indenture dated, November 17, 2017 (the Indenture), among the Company, certain of the Companys subsidiaries as guarantors, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, which Indenture governs the Companys 6.5% Senior Secured Notes (the Notes). The terms of the Indenture require that the net cash proceeds from asset dispositions (within 365 days from the date of the sale) be either utilized to (i) repay or prepay amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement unless such amounts are reinvested in similar collateral, (ii) permanently reduce other secured indebtedness and equally and ratably reduce obligations under the Notes through open market purchases of Notes at or above par, (iii) make an investment in assets that replace the collateral for the Notes or (iv) a combination of (i), (ii) and (iii). To the extent there are any remaining net proceeds from the asset disposition after application of (i), (ii) and (iii), such amounts are required to be utilized to repurchase the Notes at par.
The Company intends to utilize the net proceeds from the Transaction to fund growth initiatives by making investments in similar collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
