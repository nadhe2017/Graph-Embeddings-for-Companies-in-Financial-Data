The Company and the Backstop Investor entered into a registration rights agreement to grant the Backstop Investor certain rights to register the resale of any shares issued in the Backstop Commitment after the Business Combination.
On the Closing Date, the Company drew down $48,293,763 under the primary placement of the Forward Purchase Agreement, and issued 4,829,375 ordinary shares to the Backstop Investor.
The Backstop Investor is wholly owned by Waha Capital. The Forward Purchase Agreement contains a similar provision as the WAHA Relationship Agreement, entitling the Backstop Investor to nominate one person to NESRs board of directors for as long as it directly owns at least 7,057,453 ordinary shares within three months after the Business Combination and Adnan Ghabris is not otherwise nominated to the board; provided, however, that such nominating right shall terminate if and when the Backstop Investor fails to deliver the required purchase price in any drawdown of a secondary placement.
11
MEA Energy, an affiliate of the Backstop Investor, participated in the negotiation with NESR for the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement and represented the interests of Waha Capital, a shareholder of NPS. As the transaction was being agreed upon in early November 2017, MEA Energy approached NESR with an interest to arrange funding required to close the transaction as well as replacement capital for any redemptions through a private placement. At the start of this process MEA Energy wanted to arrange for these investors on its own and without any involvement from Waha Capital. In line with this, NESR agreed to sign a term sheet with MEA Energy for the Backstop Commitment. NESR was able to negotiate the Backstop Commitment on more favorable terms, than what NESR believed would be offered by alternative financing sources.

Additional Agreements with Hana Investments
Hana Loan Agreement
Loan Agreement

The Hana Loan matures on December 17, 2018 and can be prepaid at any time in NESR ordinary shares at a conversion rate of $11.244 per share or cash, at the election of the lender after the Company delivers five business days notice of its intent to repay the Hana Loan.

The foregoing description of the Olayan Relationship Agreement does not purport to be complete. For further information, please refer to the copy of the Relationship Agreement that is filed as Exhibit 10.14 to this Report.

The agreement also provides that the registration of securities by the Company in response to such demand can be completed by the Company offering securities in an underwritten offering and Hana Investments shall have the right to participate in any underwritten offering or by participating in certain other registrations of securities by the Company. The Company also agrees to file a shelf registration statement within 4 months following the closing of the Business Combination and to maintain the effectiveness of any shelf registration and that the Company shall file any reports or take further actions allow Hana Investments to sell any registered securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act
The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete. For further information, please refer to the copy of the Registration Rights Agreement that is filed as Exhibit 10.15 to this Report.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of NESR for the year ended December 31, 2017 included in the Proxy Statement beginning on page 57 is incorporated herein by reference.
In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of NESR for the period ended March 31, 2018 is provided below.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 are based on the historical financial statements of NESR, NPS and GES. NESR, NPS and GES shall collectively be referred to herein as the combined company.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 gives pro forma effect to the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan as if they had occurred on January 1, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 assumes that the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan were completed on March 31, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented on the basis of NESR as the accounting acquirer.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2018 has been prepared using the following:
 NESRs unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and the related notes as included in NESRs Quarterly Report on its Form 10-Q;  NPSs unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and the related notes, as included elsewhere in this Report on Form 8-K; and  GESs unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position as of March 31, 2018 and the related notes, as included elsewhere in this Report on Form 8-K.

The historical financial information of GES has been adjusted to give effect to the differences between the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company after giving effect to the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan.
The allocation of the purchase consideration for the Business Combination depends upon certain estimates and assumptions, all of which are preliminary. The allocation of the purchase consideration has been made for the purpose of developing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. A final determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed relating to the acquisition could differ materially from the preliminary allocation of purchase consideration. This final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of NPS and GES existing at the acquisition date. Therefore, certain pro forma adjustments, such as recording fair value of assets and liabilities, conversion from IFRS as issued by the IASB to US GAAP, and adjustments for consistency of accounting policy, are preliminary in this unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial information and are subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The final valuation may materially change the allocation of purchase consideration, which could materially affect the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a material change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
The Business Combination is accounted for under the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). Pursuant to ASC 805, NESR has been determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances:
 NESR transferred cash via the use of funds in NESRs trust account, issuing NESR ordinary shares, and incurred liabilities to execute the Business Combination;  NESRs executive management comprises the executive management of the combined company;  NESRs existing Board of Directors comprises 4 out of the 9 members of the Board of Directors of the combined company. Furthermore, NESRs Chief Executive Officer is the Chairman of the Board of the combined company. This provides a plurality for NESR with no other company representing more than 3 seats on the Board of the combined company. There are also no special voting rights conveyed in the Business Combination;  NESR was the entity that initiated the Business Combination; and  The headquarters of the combined company will be NESR.

NPS and GES both constitute businesses. Accordingly, the Business Combination constitutes the acquisition of such businesses for purposes of ASC 805, and due to the change in control from the Business Combination, are accounted for using the acquisition method.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1. Description of the Business Combination and Basis of Presentation
Description of the Business Combination and Basis of Presentation
On June 6, 2018, NESR, NPS and GES consummated the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan, under which NESR acquired controlling interests in the aforementioned entities.
NPS is a regional provider of products and services to the oil and gas industry in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia Pacific regions. Its revenues are primarily derived from services provided during the drilling, completion and production phases of an oil or natural gas well. NPS operates in twelve countries with the majority of its revenues derived from operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Qatar, UAE and Iraq.
GES provides drilling equipment for rental and related services, well engineering services and directional drilling services imports, and sells oilfield equipment and renders specialized services to oil companies in the Sultanate of Oman, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait and Yemen.
Description of the NPS Transaction
NESR acquired NPS pursuant to certain transactions (collectively, the NPS Transaction), in exchange for cash consideration and the issuance of NESR ordinary shares, discussed further below.
Hana Investments paid $150.0 million of the total cash requirements to certain NPS Selling Stockholders to purchase 83,660,878 shares of NPS.
On June 6, 2018, NESR acquired 100% of the outstanding NPS shares pursuant to the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2017, among NESR and Hana Investments, as purchasers, the NPS Selling Stockholders, as sellers, and NPS, pursuant to which the NPS Selling Stockholders sold to NESR and Hana Investments, in a separate closing for each purchaser, 100% of the 370,000,000 outstanding NPS shares, and pursuant to which Hana Investments exchanged its portion of the acquired NPS shares for NESR ordinary shares at the time that NESR completed the Business Combination.
At closing, NESR bought the remaining outstanding NPS shares by (i) paying the remaining $292.8 million cash required and (ii) issuing ordinary shares of NESR for the balance of the purchase price, subject to certain adjustments. NESR has also paid an additional $7.6 million in cash for the renewal of a major customer contract by NPS.
NESR bought the remaining outstanding NPS shares by (i) paying the remaining $292.8 million cash required and (ii) issuing ordinary shares of NESR for the balance of the purchase price, subject to certain adjustments. NESR has also paid an additional $7.6 million in cash for the renewal of a major customer contract by NPS.
Contemporaneously on the Closing Date, Hana Investments transferred the 83,660,878 NPS shares it acquired from the NPS Selling Stockholders to NESR in exchange for NESR ordinary shares.
Earn-out mechanisms enable the NPS Selling Stockholders to receive additional consideration after the Closing Date as follows:
 First Equity Stock Earn-Out: Up to 1,671,704 NESR ordinary shares will be issued to the NPS Selling Stockholders that exchange their shares for NESR stock if the 2018 EBITDA of NESR satisfies scheduled financial thresholds.  Second Equity Stock Earn-Out: Up to an additional 1,671,704 NESR ordinary shares will be issued to the NPS Selling Stockholders if the 2018 EBITDA of NESR satisfies scheduled thresholds higher than the First Equity Stock Earn-Out financial thresholds.

First Equity Stock Earn-Out: Up to 1,671,704 NESR ordinary shares will be issued to the NPS Selling Stockholders that exchange their shares for NESR stock if the 2018 EBITDA of NESR satisfies scheduled financial thresholds.
 Second Equity Stock Earn-Out: Up to an additional 1,671,704 NESR ordinary shares will be issued to the NPS Selling Stockholders if the 2018 EBITDA of NESR satisfies scheduled thresholds higher than the First Equity Stock Earn-Out financial thresholds.

Second Equity Stock Earn-Out: Up to an additional 1,671,704 NESR ordinary shares will be issued to the NPS Selling Stockholders if the 2018 EBITDA of NESR satisfies scheduled thresholds higher than the First Equity Stock Earn-Out financial thresholds.
NESR was subject to certain penalties for delays in receiving shareholder approval to complete the Business Combination. The NPS Selling Stockholders had negotiated a fee (the Ticker Fee) that began to accrue daily on cash not paid by January 1, 2018. On June 6, 2018, NESR entered into an agreement with the NPS Selling Stockholders to waive a portion of the Ticker Fee accrued for the period from January 1, 2018 through February 28, 2018. The resulting final Ticker Fee amounted to $13.4 million payable in cash and NESR agreed to reimburse the NPS Selling Shareholders for $5.2 million of fees, costs and expenses.
20
Description of the GES Transaction
NESR acquired GES pursuant to certain transactions (collectively, the GES Transaction), in exchange for the issuance of NESR ordinary shares, discussed further below.
On June 6, 2018, NESR acquired 88% of the outstanding shares of GES from certain owners of GES in exchange for the issuance of NESR ordinary shares.
NESR Holdings acquired the remaining 12% of the outstanding shares of GES for a total purchase price of $29.3 million. NESR Holdings organized financing of the acquisition through certain Loan Contracts with the GES Investors. NESR Holdings then assigned the GES shares which it acquired to NESR, and NESR assumed the obligation to satisfy the Loan Contracts. The Loan Contracts allowed for the GES Investors to receive either NESR ordinary shares, GES shares or cash in satisfaction of the loans, and in most of these contracts such election was at NESRs discretion, subject to the GES Investors having the right for 21 days after filing of the Definitive Proxy Statement to reject in writing acceptance of NESR ordinary shares. NESR elected to issue NESR ordinary shares to satisfy the Loan Contracts, and the GES Investors did not elect to reject in writing their acceptance of said NESR ordinary shares. The Loan Contracts were interest bearing and accrued interest of approximately $1.1 million upon settlement, with such interest being paid in NESR ordinary shares.
Description of the Hana Loan Agreement
On June 5, 2018 the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with Hana Investments, pursuant to which the Company borrowed $50,000,000 (the Hana Loan) on an unsecured basis. The Hana Loan matures on December 17, 2018 and can be prepaid at any time in NESR ordinary shares at a conversion rate of $11.244 per share or cash, at the election of the lender after the Company delivers five business days notice of its intent to repay the Hana Loan. The Hana Loan is interest bearing and will accrue interest at the greater of (i) an amount equal to $4.0 million or prorated if the loan is prepaid and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to One Month ICE LIBOR, adjusted monthly on the first day of each calendar month, plus a margin of 2.25% payable on maturity or prepaid. The interest is payable in NESR ordinary shares or cash at the election of the lender. In addition, Hana Investments has the right to convert the principal of the Hana Loan into NESR ordinary shares on or prior to maturity at a conversion rate of $11.244 per share. The loan is subject to an origination fee of $600,000 payable in NESR ordinary shares at $11.244 per share or 53,362 shares at closing of the Business Combination. If as a result of exercising any conversion rights in the Hana Loan, Hana Investments total share ownership equals or exceeds 20% of the then outstanding NESR shares, then the conversion of any amount into NESR ordinary shares will be contingent upon NESR receiving shareholder approval for such issuance of NESR ordinary shares.

Basis of Presentation
The pro forma adjustments have been prepared as if the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan had been consummated on January 1, 2017, the beginning of the earliest period presented, in the case of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, and on March 31, 2018 in the case of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, with NESR as the accounting acquirer, using the fair value concepts defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, and based on the historical consolidated financial statements of NESR, NPS and GES. Furthermore, the historical financial information of GES has been adjusted to give effect to the differences between US GAAP and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, and based on the historical consolidated financial statements of NESR, NPS and GES. Furthermore, the historical financial information of GES has been adjusted to give effect to the differences between US GAAP and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
Under the acquisition method, the acquisition-date fair value of the purchase consideration paid by NESR to effect the Business Combination was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, as described in Note 5 below. Management has made significant estimates and assumptions in determining the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration transferred in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The allocation is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have not yet been completed. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price allocation is subject to further adjustment as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses and final valuations are completed. As the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared based on these preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded may differ materially from the information presented.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not give effect to any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be associated with the Business Combination.
The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company.
The pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan are based on currently available information and certain assumptions that NESR believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited condensed pro forma adjustments may be revised as additional information becomes available. Therefore, it is likely that the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments and it is possible the difference may be material. Management believes that its assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting all of the significant effects of the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan based on information currently available to management and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
22
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations would have been had the Business Combination, the Backstop Commitment, and the Hana Loan taken place on the date indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company. They should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of NESR, NPS and GES.

Following the Business Combination, NESR will perform a comprehensive review of NPSs and GESs accounting policies. As a result of the review, management may identify differences between the accounting policies of NESR, NPS and GES which, when conformed, could have a material impact on the financial statements of the combined company. Certain reclassification adjustments have been made to NPSs and GESs historical consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 to conform to NESRs presentation.
NPS and GES
The pro forma financial information may not reflect all reclassifications necessary to conform NPSs and GESs presentations to that of NESR due to limitations on the availability of information as of the date of this Report. Accounting policy differences and additional reclassification adjustments may be identified as more information becomes available.
3. GES Historical Financial Statements
GES Historical Financial Statements
The historical financial statements of GES have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are denominated in Rial Omani.

2) The terms of the NPS transaction include specific earn-out provisions which, if achieved, will be settled in NESR ordinary shares. The first and second equity earn-outs are tied to 2018 EBITDA performance measures, with payments to be made in NESR ordinary shares, and are quantified based on expected 2018 EBITDA targets being met. Based on the range of scenarios and probabilities considered, NESR estimated equity earn-outs of 1.67 million shares at $10.185 per share (equal to $17.0 million) and 740,000 shares at $10.185 per share (equal to $7.5 million) for the first and second equity earn-outs, respectively. Combining the equity earn-outs of $17.0 million and $7.5 million, equals an estimated earn-out of $24.5 million.

Goodwill. Approximately $442.8 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the gross consideration transferred over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable definite-lived intangible assets acquired. Qualitative factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include certain intangible assets that are not recognized as separate identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill. Intangible assets not recognized apart from goodwill consist primarily of the strong market positions and the assembled workforces at NPS and GES.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized, but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present. In the event management of the combined company determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the quarter in which the determination is made may be recognized.

Overview
Description of the Business
We are a leading regional provider of products and services to the oil and gas industry in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions. Through the companys track record of delivering successful outcomes to its customers during the drilling, completion and production phases of an oil or natural gas well, NPS has built strong positions in its target markets and developed longstanding relationships with many of the worlds leading exploration and production (E&P) companies.
Throughout our nearly 40-year history, we have successfully grown and expanded our service lines and markets. We currently operate in 11 countries, with a strong presence in Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Qatar, UAE and Iraq. We have established a unique position in our markets, competing effectively against the multinational oilfield service providers while providing scale that is superior to local competition. As an independent, adaptive and regionally-focused firm, NPS can react and mobilize quickly as conditions change and opportunities arise.
Our services include a broad suite of offerings that are essential in the drilling and completion of new oil and natural gas wells and in the remedial work on existing wells, both onshore and offshore. We provide an integrated service offering that includes: Well Services and Intervention, Drilling and Workover, Wireline Logging and Testing.
Well Services and Intervention include well cementing, coiled tubing, pressure pumping and stimulation operations. Drilling and Workover Services include drilling and workovers for oil, gas and water wells. Wireline Logging and Testing include cased-hole logging, slick-line services, surface well production testing and wellhead maintenance. NPS effectively delivers this broad range of services by deploying one of the largest fleet of oilfield equipment among its regionally-based competitors, including cementing units, coiled tubing units, stimulation units, nitrogen units and oil and water well drilling rigs.
We operate in key geographies across the MENA and APAC regions, deriving more than 95% of our revenue from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Qatar, UAE and Iraq. With its vast reserves of oil and gas, the MENA region continues to dominate in its role as a vital source of global energy supply and stability.
Marketing and customers
Over our nearly 40 years in business, we have developed strong and longstanding relationships with our key customers: Saudi Aramco, Qatar Petroleum, ADCO, ADMA and other National and International Oil Companies. These relationships have been built upon a track record of offering a wide range of reliable and cost-effective services. NPS currently has over 29 active customers and operates under fixed-term contracts ranging from 3 to 5 years.

Industry Trends
Cyclical Nature of Sector
Our company provides oilfield services to E&P companies with operations in the onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration and production sectors. Demand for our services is mainly led by our customers operations and is therefore linked to global oil prices, rig activity and other factors.
The oilfield services sector is a highly cyclical industry, with the level of drilling activity by E&P companies being largely linked to oil prices which in turn are driven by global supply and demand for oil. As a result, our operating results can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. However, due to the low oil breakeven price in the MENA region and the need for infrastructure spending by the governments of these oil rich countries, we believe that we are less affected by oil price shocks as compared to other companies which operate in other regions.
Global E&P Trends and Outlook
Since the downturn in oil prices which commenced in 2014, many projects have been deferred by E&P companies, who have sought to reduce oilfield service costs in an attempt to lower their break-even points. Pricing concessions were granted by service providers in order to maintain their market share during these periods.
Global E&P spending increased by approximately 4% in 2017, which was preceded by 2 years of double-digit declines. As recent oil prices have started to rise, more projects will become economically viable and it is expected that onshore spending will increase.
Given OPECs production cuts and the recent depletion of oil inventories, we expect that production will rise in order to meet current estimated demand. With diminishing oil reserves, we also expect that any increase in oil supply will be weighted towards replacing old wells and implementing new technologies.
Drilling Types and Environments
Based on Wood Mackenzie data (extracted 3/5/2018), offshore oil production currently provides an estimated 30% of all global oil supply. Although this is a significant portion, the bulk of oil production comes from onshore activity.
NPS has operations in both onshore and offshore drilling. Offshore drilling provides higher margins due to greater complexity, logistical challenges and the need for innovative solutions. Our strategy going forward is to further target offshore drilling in the MENA and APAC regions.
Middle East Drilling
The Middle East has almost half of the worlds proven oil reserves and accounts for almost a third of oil production, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy. The countries in the Arabian Gulf account for around 23% of global oil production and given the low break-even price, it is a key region for oilfield service companies.
Most oil and gas fields in the Middle East are legacy fields in shallow waters. These fields are largely engaged in drilling activity, driven by the need for redevelopment, enhanced oil recovery via stimulation and the drilling of new production wells. Further, a number of gas fields scheduled to be developed in the near future will require oilfield services. Although the region still has low break-even levels, it is expected that more complex offshore rigs, with higher break-even prices, will be developed in the future.

Key Performance Indicators
NPS uses a variety of operational and financial measures to assess its performance. Among the measures considered by management are Revenue, Net income, and Adjusted EBITDA.
Revenue
NPS analyzes its revenue by comparing actual monthly revenue to internal projections and prior periods in order to assess performance, identify potential areas for improvement, and determine whether the business is meeting managements expectations.
Net Income
NPS views net income as an important indicator to assess performance, identify potential areas for improvement and determine whether the business is meeting managements expectations.
Adjusted EBITDA
NPS views Adjusted EBITDA as an additional important indicator of performance. NPS defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income, plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment and transaction expenses.
Transaction expenses are defined as non-recurring expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of NPS shares by NESR as detailed in Note 17 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of NPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. NPS believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors in assessing its financial performance and results of operations as NPSs board of directors, management and investors use Adjusted EBITDA to compare NPSs operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of its capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of its management team. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of NPSs results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, NPSs definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. NPSs financial statements in this Report are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Executive Overview
During the first quarter of 2017, we faced a challenging environment in many of our key end markets. Our primary focus was to grow market share while expanding our service offering and advancing our long-term growth plans. Furthermore, we have been proactive in protecting our profit margins by realigning our cost structure to the lower market pricing levels. These optimization strategies have enabled us to benefit from the activity growth which we have seen in our key markets during the first quarter of 2018.
35
Our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include:
 An increase in revenue of $22.1 million or 40% as compared to the prior years first quarter. The growth in revenue was generated largely from Saudi Arabia (up $11.8 million), Iraq (up $5.7 million) and Qatar (up $0.8 million), all of which was driven by higher Coiled Tubing and Well Testing activity in these markets and partially compensated by lower revenue in Algeria due to reduced activity combined with discounted pricing on our new Coil Tubing contract.  An increase in net income of $2.6 million or 92% from the prior years first quarter, mostly due to an increase in gross profit generated from higher revenues combined with an increase in revenue mix towards higher margin services.  An increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million or 47% as compared to the prior years first quarter. The increase was driven by higher activity levels during the first quarter of 2018. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA remained approximately the same during the first quarters of 2018 and 2017.

Since 2016, our key focus has been to maintain a proper balance between delivering solid operating results and advancing our strategic goals. The following highlights a few examples of strategic actions which occurred during the first quarter of 2018 and which we believe will help position us well for long-term value creation.
 In Saudi Arabia, we have deployed 2 additional CT units resulting in an increase in stimulation revenue in rig-less activity. There has also been higher activity in Well Testing under LSTK (Lump Sum Turnkey) contracts which were awarded last year, with two additional Testing packages deployed in Q1 2018.  In Algeria we commenced mobilization of a single Coiled Tubing package which is expected to generate revenue in Q2 2018.  In Oman, better drilling performance and an increase in footage drilled have resulted in higher revenues on our top hole drilling contract.  In Iraq, our Coiled Tubing packages are now working 24 hours which resulted in more well intervention activity as compared to Q1 of last year. We have also deployed two additional Well Testing flare-less units.  In Indonesia, we are staging our third Wireline Logging unit which is expected to generate revenue in late Q2 2018 and which will capture future activity on geothermal wells.  In the UAE, we have deployed an additional Coiled Tubing package, with a second package being prepared for deployment in Q2 2018.

We believe that the demand for our services will increase in line with the market activity growth. While drilling and completions activities have improved along with oil prices increasing from their lows in early 2016, we believe our long-term growth will be driven by:
 Increases in customer drilling budgets, focused in our core service areas, and an expected increase in rig count in the MENA region;  Expanding our service offerings in existing key markets and extending operations into new geographies;  Increasing our services on more complex offshore as well as gas-wells related services; and  Shifting focus towards higher margin and high technology service lines, including Wireline Logging and Testing services.

Revenue. Revenue is generated largely from Well Services, which represented 85.4% of total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 83.35% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Despite continued pressures on pricing, revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $22.1 million, or 40%, to $76.8 million from $54.7 million in the equivalent period in 2017. The increase is largely due to higher well services activity in Saudi Arabia (up $11.8 million) and Iraq (up $5.7 million) which were partially offset by lower revenue in Algeria (down $2.7 million).
Cost of Services. Cost of services for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $16.4 million, or 39%, to $58.2 million from $41.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was driven by higher customer activity levels. Total cost of services as a percentage of total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 is 76%, which represented no change from the equivalent period in 2017
37
Cost of services includes depreciation of $10.3 million and $9.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively relating to key equipment used in supporting and managing our operations.
Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense, as reported below Gross Margin, represents depreciation of head office fixtures and fittings as well as amortization of acquired customer contracts. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $0.07 million, or 45%, to $0.09 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $0.16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, largely due to lower cost of amortization of 0.06 million).
Selling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased $1.8 million, or 24%, to $9.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $7.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in SG&A expense is due to higher personnel compensation costs driven by an increase in staff headcount to support higher activity levels. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense decreased to 12% of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 14% in the equivalent period in 2017, both as a result of higher activity levels as well as continued cost control discipline across all business functions.
Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by $1.3 million, or 79%, to $2.8 million from $1.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was attributable to both higher LIBOR rates and higher fixed interest charges on the Murabaha bank loan, in addition to incremental interest charges arising on the new Bridge Loan facility which was drawn down in early February 2018.
Other income, net. Other income, net, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by $0.02 million, or 17%, to $0.09 million from $0.11 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is largely due to higher income from disposal of fixed assets combined with lower bank charges in 2018.
Net income. Net income was $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared with net income of $2.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net income was due to an increase in the gross margin generated as a result of higher activity levels in the current quarter.
Liquidity
Our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. At March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $27.9 million compared to $39.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017.
At March 31, 2018, $27.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries compared to $39.2 million at March 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries includes amounts of $7.1 million and $7.3 million held within the sub-holding company of NPS Bahrain at March 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
We have a committed revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) with commercial banks under which the maximum borrowing at any time is $50.0 million. At March 31, 2018, we had borrowings under the credit facility of $7.0 million due within one year. During the first quarter of 2018, we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of short term borrowings, and the payment of employees end of service benefits.
A substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at each of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 was reinvested in our international operations as our current intent is to use this cash to, among other things, fund the operations of our foreign subsidiaries. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the United Arab Emirates, we may be required to pay withholding tax on some of these funds, mainly in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Algeria. However, the repatriation of funds to the UAE is largely in the form of settlement of inter-company balances relating to purchases of fixed assets and inventory by the holding company, which is not subject to withholding taxes.
38
The Company does not face any significant capital restrictions on cash outflows from foreign subsidiaries to the holding company or other group companies.
We believe that cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and liquidity available through our credit facility, including the issuance of commercial papers will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs.
Cash Flows
Cash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017:

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities provided cash of $11.0 million and $25.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to changes in the components of our working capital (unbilled revenues, receivables, inventories and accounts payable) compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Investing Activities
Cash flows used in investing activities was ($7.3) million and ($7.6) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease of $0.4 million in cash used is primarily attributed to an increase of $2.7 million in the funding of capital assets (funding was $10.3 million and $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) and an increase of $3.0 million of investments in short-term deposits with banks. Our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. The increase in capital expenditures was the result of our revenue growth.
There were no disposal of assets for the three months ended March 31, 2018 nor 2017, respectively.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used in financing activities were $0.3 million and $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease of $3.5 million in cash used was primarily due to increase in our borrowing activity, which was partially offset by the payment of dividends to our shareholders. Our principal recurring financing activity is the borrowing and repayment of debt to ensure that we have the appropriate levels of liquidity as well as the payment of dividends and Zakat on behalf of our shareholders.
39
We had net draws of commercial paper and other short-term debt of $50.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, and net repayments of $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.
We paid $48.2 million of dividends to our shareholders in the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Murabaha Credit Facilities
$150 Million Facility
The Company entered into a syndicated Murabaha facility (the Facility) for $150.0 million which was fully drawn by the Company on November 26, 2014. Murabaha is an Islamic financing structure where a set fee is charged rather than interest. This type of loan is legal in Islamic countries as banks are not authorized to charge interest on loans, hence banks charge a flat fee for continuing daily operations of the bank, in lieu of interest.
The Facility of $150.0 million is from a syndicate of three commercial banks. The Facility is repayable in semi-annual instalments ranging from $7.5 million to $19.3 million commencing from May 26, 2017 with the last instalment due on November 26, 2020. The Facility carries a set fee which equals to the stated interest rate of six months LIBOR plus a fixed profit margin of 2.9% per annum. The Facility is partially secured by personal guarantees of two individual shareholders on a pro-rata basis with their respective shareholding percentages. Letters of awareness have been executed by the corporate shareholders as credit support for the Facility.
On May 28, 2017, the Facility (Amended Facility) was amended to extend the maturity of the agreement. The Amended Facility is repayable in quarterly installments ranging from $1.1 million to $57.9 million commencing from August 1, 2019 with the last installment due on May 28, 2025. The Amended Facility carries a stated interest rate of three months LIBOR plus a fixed profit margin of 3.25% per annum. The Amended Facility is partially secured by personal guarantee of one individual shareholder on a pro-rata basis with his shareholding percentage. Letters of awareness have been executed by the corporate shareholders as credit support for the Facility.
All of the other terms of the Facility remained the same except the fixed interest charge was revised from 2.9% in 2014 to 3.25% in 2017. The costs of our loan arrangement fees increased to $0.10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $0.08 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
The Amended Facility contains certain covenants, which, among other things, require the maintenance of a total debt-to-total capitalization ratio, restrict certain merger transactions or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a significant subsidiary and limit the amount of subsidiary indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Amended Facility may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the Amended Facility, covenant defaults and other customary defaults. As of March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys covenants.
$50 Million Facility
We have a committed revolving credit facility with commercial banks under which the maximum borrowing at any time is $50.0 million. Borrowings under this facility are only used to fund capital expenditures. At March 31, 2018, we had borrowings under the credit facility of $7.0 million due within one year. During the first quarter of 2018, we used cash generated by our operations to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of short term borrowings, and the payment of employees end of service benefits.
$50 Million Term Loan
The Company entered into an additional $50.0 million term facility (the Term Loan) on February 4, 2018 with APICORP. The loan is repayable by August 1, 2018. The facility carries a stated interest rate of one month LIBOR plus a fixed profit margin of 1.50% per annum or $0.9 million until August 1, 2018. Borrowings under this facility were used to fund a special dividend issued to our shareholders.
40
If market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Should this occur, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including additional borrowing under the credit facility.
Capital Resources
In the next twelve months, we believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the available credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may use short-term debt to fund cash needs in various countries in excess of the cash generated in those specific countries.
Our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. In light of the current market conditions, capital expenditures in the next twelve months will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal $30 million to $35 million on an annualized basis. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $3 million to $5 million in the next twelve months. For employees end of service benefits, we expect to pay between $1 million to $3 million to employees in the next twelve months. See Note 9. Employee benefits of the notes to NPSs consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
As discussed above, the Companys total capital expenditures in the next twelve months is estimated to be equal to $30 million to $35 million on an annualized basis. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. Capital expenditures are financed through the Revolving Credit Facility. There is sufficient capacity under this credit facility to meet our capital expenditure commitments.
Other Factors Affecting Liquidity
Guarantee agreements. In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, the Company has entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, and other bank issued guarantees, which totaled $(Nil) million and $27.9 million as of March 31, 2018 and as of December 31, 2017, respectively. A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Customer receivables. In line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets as well as unsettled political conditions. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. Two of our three largest customers, Saudi Aramco and Sonatrach, are owned by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Algeria, respectively. It is customary for Saudi Aramco to delay payments of a portion (10%) of receivables until all taxes due within the country are fully paid and settled.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
At March 31, 2018, NPS had $150.0 million of long-term debt outstanding, with an interest rate of 3 months LIBOR plus 3.25%. Interest is calculated under the terms of NPSs Murabaha agreement. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding, the impact on interest expense of a 1% increase or decrease in the interest rate would be approximately $1.5 million per year. NPS does not currently have or intend to enter into any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to NPS outstanding indebtedness.
41
Foreign Currency Risk
NPS is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include transaction gains and losses associated with Intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a locations functional currency.
US dollar balances in the UAE, KSA and Qatar entities are not considered to represent significant currency risk as the respective currencies in these countries are pegged to the U.S. dollar. The companys foreign currency risk arises from the settlement of transactions in currencies other than the Companys functional currency, specifically in Algerian Dinar, Libyan Dinar, Indian Rupee and Indonesian Rupiah. However, customer contracts in these countries are largely denominated in US dollars.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument may fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. NPS is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and other receivables and certain other assets as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.
The Company seeks to manage its credit risk with respect to banks by only dealing with reputable banks and with respect to customers by monitoring outstanding receivables and ensuring close follow-ups. Management also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base including the default risk of the industry and the country in which the customers operate. The Company sells its products to a large number of customers, mainly to national oil companies in the GCC region. The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco), owned by the government of Saudi Arabia, and Sonatrach, owned by the government of Algeria, represented 33% (38% in 2017) and 22% (25% in 2017) of the Companys accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2018. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Companys accounts receivable balance.
With respect to credit risk arising from the financial assets of the Company, including receivables and bank balances, the Companys exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held with banks and financial institution counterparties, which are rated A1 to Baa3, based on Moodys ratings.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Companys approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses, or risking its liabilities. The company maintains cash flow forecasts to monitor its liquidity position.
Accounts payable are normally settled within the terms of purchase from the supplier. As detailed on page 41, the company has sufficient un-utilized capacity under its revolving credit facility to manage short term financing requirements in relation to its capital expenditure.
Market Risk
NPS is exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates on its long-term borrowings as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to its foreign subsidiaries and where local exchange rates are not pegged to the US Dollar (Algeria, Libya and Iraq). However, the foreign exchange risk is largely mitigated by the fact that all customer contracts are denominated in US Dollars.
NPS does not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity.
42
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, such as surety bonds for performance, and other bank issued guarantees. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments. None of the off-balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
As of March 31, 2018, we had no material off-balance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.
Related Party Transactions
Related parties include shareholders, key management personnel, and jointly controlled entities. In the ordinary course of business, such related parties provide goods and render services to the Company at mutually agreed rates. In addition, certain shareholders received short-term loans and or advances in connection with the sale of the business to the new shareholders in 2014, all of which were subsequently fully settled by the respective parties. The transactions with related parties are made at mutually agreed terms. Outstanding balances are unsecured, interest free and settlement occurs in cash.
For further details about our transactions with related parties please refer to Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions and Note 12. Related party transactions of the notes to NPSs consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and, accordingly, these estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes.
We have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain. Our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past two fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with NPS consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this document.
Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. No interest is charged on past-due balances. The Company grants credit to customers based upon an evaluation of each customers financial condition. The Company periodically monitors the payment history and ongoing creditworthiness of customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowances management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customers financial conditions, the amount of receivable in dispute, current receivables ageing and current payment patterns. Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability.
43
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repair is charged to operating expense, while replacement of critical components and major improvements that extend the life of the related asset are capitalized. Capital work in progress mainly represents costs incurred on drilling rigs and equipment which are in transit at the reporting date. No depreciation is charged to purchase capital work in progress. Depreciation or amortization of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings and leasehold Improvements 5 to 25 years or the estimated lease period, whichever is shorter Drilling rigs, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Office equipment and tools 3 to 6 years Vehicles and cranes 5 to 8 years
5 to 25 years or the estimated lease period, whichever is shorter
Drilling rigs, plant and equipment 3 to 15 years
3 to 15 years
Furniture and fixtures 5 years
5 years
Office equipment and tools 3 to 6 years
3 to 6 years
Vehicles and cranes 5 to 8 years
5 to 8 years
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Indicative events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, matters such as a significant decline in market value or a significant change in business climate (triggering events). An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
The amount of impairment loss recognized is the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. In determining the fair market value of the assets, the Company considers market trends and recent transactions involving sales of similar assets, or when not available, discounted cash flow analysis. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less cost to sell. Upon sale or other disposition of an asset, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on disposal measured as the difference between the net carrying value of the asset and the net proceeds received.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances require. The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, no further testing is required. If the Company determines, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment assessment is performed using a two-step, fair value-based test. Under the first step, goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting units net assets (including allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, discount rates operating margins, weighted average costs of capital, market share and future market conditions, among others. If the reporting units carrying value is greater than its fair value, a second step is performed whereby the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation analysis. If the amount of goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill, the recorded carrying value of goodwill is written down to the implied fair value.
Intangible assets
The Companys intangible assets with finite lives consist of customer contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of NPS Bahrain in 2014. The cost of intangible assets with finite lives is amortized over the estimated period of economic benefit, ranging from 1 to 3 years. Asset lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit. No residual value has been assigned to these intangible assets.
acquired in connection with the acquisition of NPS Bahrain in 2014. The cost of intangible assets with finite lives is amortized over the estimated period of economic benefit, ranging from 1 to 3 years. Asset lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit. No residual value has been assigned to these intangible assets.
44
Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. These conditions may include a change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used or a change in future operations. The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying amount by preparing estimates of future revenue, margins, and cash flows. If the sum of expected future cash flows (undiscounted) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Fair value of these assets may be determined by a variety of methodologies, including discounted cash flow models.
Revenue recognition
The Companys revenues are generated principally from providing services and the related equipment. Revenues are recognized when the services are rendered and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues from services and equipment are based on fixed or determinable priced purchase orders or contracts with the customer and do not include the right of return. Rates for services and equipment are priced on a per day, per unit of measure, per man hour or similar basis. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Services performed but not billed at the end of the reporting period are classified as unbilled revenues. The unbilled revenues for services performed are calculated based on the rates stated in the purchase orders or contracts with the customers. The unbilled revenues are typically billed within one to six months depending on the nature of customer contract.
Zakat
Zakat is provided for Saudi Arabian subsidiaries in accordance with Saudi Arabian fiscal regulation. The provision is not charged through consolidated statement of income but instead charged through equity. Zakat is a shareholder obligation and is computed on the Saudi shareholders share of equity or net income using the basis defined under the Zakat regulations.
Income taxes
The Company is based in the Emirate of Dubai (Dubai) in the UAE, where no federal taxation exists. Dubai has issued corporate tax decrees that theoretically apply to all businesses established in the UAE. However, in practice, these laws have not been applied. The Company has not paid or accounted for any payment of income taxes since its inception. The Company is aware of the risk that the tax decrees may be more generally applied in Dubai in the future and of the remote risk that they may be applied retrospectively. The Company has provided for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the foreign countries where the Company operates and earns income. The income taxes in these jurisdictions vary substantially.
The Company recognizes the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets are dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to an underpayment of income taxes, where applicable, in its consolidated statements of operations as a component of income tax expense.
45
Internal Controls and Procedures
NPS is not currently required to comply with the SECs rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and is therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of NPSs internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to becoming a subsidiary of a public company, NPSs publicly traded parent company will be required to comply with the SECs rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will require its management to certify financial and other information in its quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of NPSs internal control over financial reporting.

Description of the Business
GES was incorporated in the Sultanate of Oman as a limited liability company on May 31, 2005. On June 20, 2013, GES became a closed Omani joint stock company. The business activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Company) include providing drilling equipment on rental and related services, providing well engineering services, directional drilling services, import and sale of oilfield equipment and rendering of specialized services to oil companies. The Company consists of twelve locally incorporated subsidiaries.
GES operates largely in the Sultanate of Oman. We also have operations in other key geographies across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
GES has established a solid position in Drilling Technology Solutions, Well Intervention and Fishing & Remedial services. GES has expanded its services portfolio in recent years and now the Company provides a broad suite of product and service offerings that are essential in the drilling and completion of new oil and natural gas wells and in the remedial work on existing wells. GES operates through eight service lines: Well Intervention Services, Drilling Technology Solutions, Fishing & Remedial Services, Work-over Services, Performance Drilling & Evaluation, Production & Completion Services, Drilling & Completion Fluids Technology and Services, and Environmental Services.
Most of Omans oil production is generated from technically challenging reservoirs. The countrys reservoir formations are hard in nature, located in a wide range of depths and produce a wide range of American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity oil. Due to these technical challenges, well rates and recovery factors are generally lower in the country as compared to regional peers. GES has a strong fleet of tools and equipment and advanced API certified facilities for efficient maintenance and repair of its tools and equipment. These facilities are located in each of Nizwa, to support operations in the North of Oman, and in Nimr, to support operations in the South.

Marketing and Customers
GES has leveraged its technical abilities and track record of successful operations to establish long-tenured relationships with its client base which includes the major operators in Oman, in particular Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), British Petroleum (BP), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY), and Medco Energy. We are also currently working to increase our operations with international clients like Saudi Aramco, Sonatrach and Kuwait Oil Company. In our target regions, contract duration is typically at least three years and customer retention rates are generally high as our clients do not switch oilfield service providers frequently. GES has a successful track record of extending its contracts with a renewal rate greater than 90% over the past five years.

Industry Trends
GES operates in key geographies within the MENA region, which continues to be a vital source of global energy supply. According to Douglas Westwood Onshore Drilling and Production Outlook dated Q4 2017, during the recent industry downturn the MENA region saw less of a reduction in oil and gas activities than North America. In many MENA countries, the energy sector continues to serve as the major source of national revenues. Even at lower oil and gas prices, such oil and gas dependent economies have continued to maintain significant production activities. Further, the Middle East markets have among the lowest breakeven cost of oil and natural gas production in the world, which enables them to continue to produce profitably at significantly lower commodity prices.
Projected increases in energy demand are expected to lead to sustained capital expenditures on drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas wells in the MENA region. The rise in oil prices in the last six months has provided relative stability to the market. However, the adherence of Oman to OPECs requirement to reduce production by an estimated 5% has affected activity in certain areas of our business.
Key Performance Indicators
GES uses a variety of operational and financial measures to assess its performance. Among the measures considered by management are Revenue, Net income, and Adjusted EBITDA.
Revenue
GES analyzes its revenue by comparing actual monthly revenue to internal projections and prior periods in order to assess performance, identify potential areas for improvement, and determine whether the business is meeting managements expectations.
Net Income
GES views net income as an important indicator in order to assess performance, identify potential areas for improvement, and determine whether the business is meeting managements expectations.
47
Adjusted EBITDA
GES views Adjusted EBITDA as an additional important indicator of performance. GES defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment and transaction expenses.
Transaction expenses are defined as non-recurring expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of GES shares by NESR.
NESR.
Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. GES believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors in assessing its financial performance and results of operations as GESs board of directors, management and investors use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare GESs operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of its capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of its management team. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of GESs results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, GESs definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. GESs financial statements in this Report are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Executive Overview
During both the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017, the industry faced a challenging environment in many of our key markets. Our primary focus was to maintain our market share in Oman while expanding our geographical footprint and service offering in order to sustain our long-term growth plans.
Our results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include:
 A decrease in net revenue of RO 2.4 million or 13% as compared to the prior years first quarter. The decrease was due to the expiry of a significant client contract of RO 3.2 million, partially offset with higher activity under ongoing contracts of RO 0.8 million, of which RO 0.3 million was generated from Oman operations and RO 0.5 million came from our MENA region operations outside of Oman.  A decrease in net income of RO 2.6 million or 94%, from 15% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to 1% of revenue in the first quarter of 2018, mostly due to the termination of a significant international drilling equipment rental contract which had higher profit margins relative to ongoing activities.  A decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of RO 2.7 million or 47% as compared to the prior years first quarter. As a percentage of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA decreased from 32% of revenue in the first quarter of 2017 to 20% of revenue in 2018, largely due to a change in the revenue mix with the termination of a significant international drilling equipment rental contract as explained above.

In 2018, our key focus was on client service delivery in order to enhance our market share. The following highlights a few examples of strategic actions that occurred during the period which management believes will position the Company well for long-term value creation:
 In Oman, we have secured a 4 year contract representing the Companys first Integrated Services Project covering 19 services and commencing in June 2018.  We have been awarded an 8-year exclusive contract for downhole tool rentals in Upper Shuaiba, commencing in July 2018.  We were awarded a 3 month extension to our Hoist Services contract, commencing in May 2018.  We were awarded a new contract for 3 years covering Fishing Services and commencing in February 2018.  We have secured a new contract for downhole tool rentals, covering a scope of 8 wells in 2018 and commencing from April 2018

Net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by RO 2.4 million, or 13%, to RO 15.6 million from RO 18.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was due to the expiry of a significant client contract of RO 3.2 million, partially offset with higher activity under ongoing contracts of RO 0.8 million
Direct Costs. Direct costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by RO 0.4 million, or 7%, to RO 6.0 million from RO 5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Direct costs as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 38% compared to 31% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which represents an increase of 7%. Such increases were mainly due to a change in revenue mix towards higher inventory or product intensive segments, partially offset by the non-repeat of the reversal of excess inventory provisions which were recorded in the first quarter of the prior year.
Staff Costs. Staff costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by RO 0.2 million, or 4%, to RO 4.9 million from RO 5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 largely due to staff headcount reductions which were implemented. Staff costs as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 31% compared to 28% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, which represents an increase of 3%. This increase as a percentage of total revenue was due to the change in revenue mix resulting from the termination a significant equipment rental contract which had higher margins relative to ongoing business operations.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by RO 0.3 million, or 14%, to RO 2.0 million from RO 2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 12% and 13% respectively, which represents a decrease of 1%. This decrease in depreciation and amortization was as a result of some fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during the prior year.

Administrative and general expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by RO 0.2 million, or 12%, to RO 1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from RO 1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in administrative and general expenses is mostly due to an increase in professional fees and transaction expenses associated with the purchase of GES shares by SCF Partners and NESR .

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities provided cash of RO 0.5 million and RO 3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities decreased by RO 3.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to a decrease in profit before tax as well as changes in the working capital components (inventories, trade and other receivables and trade payables) for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
Investing Activities
Our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations.
Cash flows used in investing activities increased by RO 0.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Expenditures for capital assets including capital work in progress totaled RO 1.3 million and RO 0.4 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures (CAPEX) in the first quarter of 2018 is due to ramp up of new equipment to service new contract awards as summarized in the Executive Overview above and for which the Company anticipates an increase in activity and revenues largely in the second half of 2018 .
52
Proceeds from the disposal of assets were RO 0.08 million and RO (null) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The disposals related to idle and obsolete tools and drilling equipment.
Financing Activities
Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by RO 2.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, mainly as a result in net cash outflow from repayment of borrowings of RO 2.2 million (RO 3.7 million in 2017), partially offset by net cash inflows for related party balances of RO 0.8 million (outflow of RO 2.6 million in 2017), net cash inflow resulting from the net movement in short term bank borrowings during the respective quarter of RO 0.4 million (RO 2.3 million in 2017) and net cash inflow from bank borrowings availed of RO 0.6 million (RO 1.0 million in 2017).
Capital Resources
For the upcoming twelve month period, cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the available overdraft facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. If necessary, we may use short-term debt to fund cash needs in excess of the cash generated from operations.
Our objective when managing capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Capital is monitored based on the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the statement of financial position plus net debt.
Details of the Companys bank covenants and its compliance thereto are set out in Note 10 of the Financial Statements.
Market Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk associated with the fluctuations in market interest rates and the effect it has on the financial position and cash flows of GES. The risk arises when interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities are affected by the interest rate volatility within a specified period. GES is exposed to interest rate risk primarily on its long-term LIBOR based loan from the National Bank of Oman SAOG and Ahli Bank.
Related Party Transactions
Related parties comprise the shareholders, key management personnel, subsidiary companies, jointly controlled entity, and associate, business entities in which the Company has the ability to control of exercise significant influence in financial and operating decisions and other related parties which are part of Mubadarah Investment LLC Group. In the ordinary course of business, such related parties provide goods and render services to the Group at mutually agreed rates.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.
We base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, estimates that involve uncertainties and judgments which have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements include provisions for impairment of receivables and inventories.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill
GES assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the Groups business plans, changes in the Groups assumptions about commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated oil and gas reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, GES makes an estimate of the assets or CGUs recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. A CGUs recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the Group and not applicable to entities in general. An assessment is made at each year end as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Judgment is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes.
54
As disclosed above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on similar recent market transaction data or, where recent market transactions for the asset are not available for reference, using discounted cash flow techniques. Where discounted cash flow analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, accounting judgments are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.
Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Interest and penalties relating to income tax are also included in the income tax expense. Income tax is recognized in the Statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of profit and loss because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:
 where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill  where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a Business Combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill
 where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a Business Combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a Business Combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
55
The computation of GESs income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the Group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgment is required to determine provisions for income taxes. In addition, the Group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilized. Management judgment is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the amount of future taxable profits that will be available.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. No interest is charged on past-due balances. The Group grants credit to customers based upon an evaluation of each customers financial condition. The Group periodically monitors the payment history and ongoing creditworthiness of customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established at a level estimated by the Groups management to be adequate based upon various factors including historical experience, aging status of customer accounts, payment history and financial condition of customers. Significant individual accounts receivable balances and balances which have been outstanding greater than 90 days are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances, when determined to be uncollectable, are charged against the allowance.
Internal Controls and Procedures
GES is not currently required to comply with the SECs rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and is therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of GES internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. Subsequent to becoming a subsidiary of a public company, GES publicly traded parent company will be required to comply with the SECs rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will require its management to certify financial and other information in its quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of GES internal control over financial reporting.

Classified Board of Directors
In accordance with our Charter, our Board of Directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year at a meeting of shareholders, with each class serving a two-year term.
Director Independence
NASDAQ listing standards require that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent as long as we are not a controlled company. As of the closing of the Business Combination, a majority of our Board of Directors are independent. An independent director is defined under the NASDAQ rules generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the companys Board of Directors, would interfere with the directors exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Antonio J. Campo Mejia, Hala Zeibak, Thomas Wood, Salem Al Noaimi, Andrew Waite and Nadhmi Al-Nasr are independent directors as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
As of the Business Combination, it is intended that Mr. Campo will be the lead independent director of the Board of Directors and Mr. Sherif Foda continues to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.
The Board of Directors oversight of risk is administered directly through the Board of Directors, as a whole, or through its audit committee. Various reports and presentations regarding risk management are presented to the Board of Directors including the procedures that the Company has adopted to identify and manage risk. The audit committee addresses risks that fall within the committees area of responsibility. For example, the audit committee is responsible for overseeing the quality and objectivity of NESRs financial statements and the independent audit thereof. The audit committee reserves time at each of its meetings to meet with the Companys independent registered public accounting firm outside of the presence of the Companys management.
Committees of the Board of Directors
As of the closing of the Business Combination, the standing committees of the Companys Board consist of an audit committee (the Audit Committee), a compensation committee (the Compensation Committee) and a nominating and corporate governance committee (the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee). Each of the committees reports to the Board. The composition, duties and responsibilities of these committees are set forth below.
Audit Committee
Our Audit Committee consists of Mr. Al Noaimi, Mr. Campo, and Mr. Waite, with Mr. Al Noaimi serving as the chairman of the Audit Committee. We believe that each of these individuals qualify as independent directors according to the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect to audit committee membership. We also believe that Mr. Al Noaimi qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K. Our Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our corporate website at www.nesrco.com.
62
Compensation Committee
Our Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Campo, Ms. Zeibak and Mr. Wood, with Mr. Wood serving as the chairman of the Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available on our corporate website at www.nesrco.com.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
A Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee was appointed to be responsible for, among other matters: (1) identifying individuals qualified to become members of our Board of Directors, consistent with criteria approved by our Board of Directors; (2) overseeing the organization of our Board of Directors to discharge the boards duties and responsibilities properly and efficiently; (3) identifying best practices and recommending corporate governance principles; and (4) developing and recommending to our Board of Directors a set of corporate governance guidelines and principles applicable to us.
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee consists of Mr. Wood, Mr. Al-Nasr and Mr. Campo, with Mr. Campo serving as the chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Our Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which is available on our corporate website at www.nesrco.com.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
From inception through March 31, 2018, no officer or employee served as a member of the Companys Compensation Committee, except for Mr. Thomas Wood, who served as NESRs Chief Financial Officer from our inception until October 2, 2017 and from November 29, 2017 until June 6, 2018. None of our executive officers serve as a member of the Board of Directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our ordinary shares to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such forms, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2017 there were no delinquent filers.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all of our employees, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and principal accounting officer. Our Code of Ethics is available on our corporate website, www.nesrco.com. If we amend or grant a waiver of one or more of the provisions of our Code of Ethics, we intend to satisfy the requirements under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding the disclosure of amendments to or waivers from provisions of our Code of Ethics that apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer by posting the required information on our website at the above address. Our website is not part of this proxy statement.
Along with our guiding core ethical principles, our unwavering commitment to achieve responsible superior financial results, motivation of our employees and diversity of our culture are three main pillars that defines our company. We emphasize honesty and integrity, accountability, respect, fairness and confidentiality. We also take monitoring and compliance measures to ensure against discrimination, fraud, theft, harassment, retaliation and conflict of interest.
This Code of Conduct governs all sets of actions and applies to the behaviors of all employees socially and professionally throughout their employment with the company irrespective of the place, time and situation.
Ethical principles and our three main pillars combined are fundamental core values to the Company.
63
Director Compensation
Our compensation committee determines the annual compensation to be paid to the members of our Board of Directors. Directors fees after the Business Combination have yet to be determined but are expected to consist of two components: a cash payment and the issuance of restricted shares.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Pre-Closing Compensation of Executive Officers
Prior to consummation of the Business Combination, NESR had two executive officers, neither of whom was paid a salary by the Company.
The compensation of NPSs and GESs named executive officers before the consummation of the Business Combination is set forth in the Proxy Statement in the sections titled Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers of NPS and Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers of GES beginning on page 144 and on page 174, respectively, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Post-Closing Compensation of Executive Officers
Overview
Following the closing of the Business Combination, the Company intends to develop an executive compensation program that is consistent with its existing compensation policies and philosophies, which are designed to align compensation with Target Companies business objectives and the creation of shareholder value, while enabling Target Companies to attract, motivate and retain individuals who contribute to the long-term success of Target Companies.
Decisions on the executive compensation program will be made by the compensation committee. The following discussion is based on the present expectations as to the executive compensation program to be adopted by the compensation committee. The executive compensation program actually adopted will depend on the judgment of the members of the compensation committee and may differ from that set forth in the following discussion.
We anticipate that decisions regarding executive compensation will reflect our belief that the executive compensation program must be competitive in order to attract and retain our executive officers. We anticipate that the compensation committee will seek to implement our compensation policies and philosophies by linking a significant portion of our executive officers cash compensation to performance objectives and by providing a portion of their compensation as long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards (for more information relating to our intended equity compensation plan, please refer to the Incentive Plan Proposal).
We anticipate that compensation for our executive officers will have three primary components: base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus and long-term incentive compensation in the form of share-based awards.
Base Salary
It has been Target Companies historical practice to assure that base salary is fair to the executive officers, competitive within the industry and reasonable in light of Target Companies cost structure. Upon completion of the Business Combination, our compensation committee will determine base salaries and manage the base salary review process, subject to existing employment agreements.
Annual Bonuses
The Company intends to use annual cash incentive bonuses for the executive officers to tie a portion of their compensation to financial and operational objectives achievable within the applicable fiscal year. The Company expects that, near the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee will select the performance targets, target amounts, target award opportunities and other term and conditions of annual cash bonuses for the executive officers, subject to the terms of any employment agreement. Following the end of each year, the Compensation Committee will determine the extent to which the performance targets were achieved and the amount of the award that is payable to the executive officers.
65
Share-Based Awards
On May 18, 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved the NESR 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP), effective upon the closing of the Business Combination. The description of the LTIP set forth in the Proxy Statement section titled Proposal No. 4  NESR 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan beginning on page 115 is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the full text of the LTIP is filed as Exhibit 10.10 to this Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company intends to use share-based awards to reward long-term performance of the executive officers. The Company believes that providing a meaningful portion of the total compensation package in the form of share-based awards will align the incentives of its executive officers with the interests of its shareholders and serve to motivate and retain the individual executive officers.
Employment Agreements
One June 12, 2018 the Company signed an offer letter with Melissa Cougle regarding her employment as Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective June 18, 2018. The terms of Ms. Cougles employment are set forth in an offer letter dated June 12, 2018, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.18 to this Report. Pursuant to the terms of the offer letter, Ms. Cougle will serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and will report to Sherif Foda, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Ms. Cougles annual salary will be $300,000 and she will be eligible for an annual performance bonus set at a target of 100% of her salary based on performance of key performance indicators and she will receive a share-based incentive targeted at 200% of her base salary comprised of a mix of restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock options as determined by the NESR Board.
Other Compensation
The Company expects to maintain various employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, life insurance and retirement plans, in which the executive officers will participate.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The following is a description of related party transactions involving NESR, NPS and GES in the last three years, other than as described in Item 1.01 of this Report.
NESR Related Person Transactions
Founder Shares
On February 9, 2017, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 ordinary shares to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On May 11, 2017, the Company effectuated a 1.05-for-1 subdivision of its ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 6,037,500 Founder Shares being held by the Sponsor of these 6,037,500 shares, an aggregate of up to 787,500 ordinary shares were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor would own 20% of the Companys issued and outstanding shares after the IPO. As a result of the underwriters election to partially exercise their over-allotment option on May 30, 2017, 480,425 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The underwriters elected not to exercise the remaining portion of the over-allotment option and, therefore, 307,075 Founder Shares were forfeited.
Sponsor maintained legal and voting rights to the Founder Shares while Mr. Foda and Mr. Wood maintained control of beneficial ownership. The Sponsor has agreed that, subject to certain limited exceptions, its Founder Shares will not be transferred, assigned or sold until one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier if, subsequent to a Business Combination, the last sales price of the Companys ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after a Business Combination. Before the IPO, Mr. Foda and Mr. Wood, as beneficial owners of shares issued to Sponsor to maintain voting control, assigned beneficial ownership to some Founder Shares to certain key persons facilitating the organization of the IPO.
Private Warrants
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of 11,850,000 private warrants at a price of $0.50 per private warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,925,000. Additionally, on May 30, 2017, in connection with the underwriters election to partially exercise their over-allotment option in the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 768,680 private warrants at $0.50 per warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $384,340. The private warrants, which were purchased by the Companys Sponsor, are substantially similar to the public warrants, except that if held by the original holders or their permitted assigns, they (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of the Companys initial business combination. If the private warrants are held by holders other than its initial holders, the private warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the public warrants. The proceeds from the private placement were added to the proceeds from our IPO held in the trust account.
Related Party Advances
During the period from January 23, 2017 (inception) through May 17, 2017, the Sponsor advanced the Company an aggregate of $193,899 for costs associated with its IPO and for working capital purposes.

The Working Capital Loans would either be paid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the holders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the Working Capital Loans may be converted into Private Warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant. There were no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017.

Falcon Oil Services LLC Arbitration. In 2017, an arbitration award of $875,000 was entered against GES. The arbitration relates to a subcontract entered into between Falcon Oil Services LLC (Falcon Oil Services), a company in which Hilal Al Busaidy owns a minority interest, and GES Oman in relation to services GES Oman had contracted to provide to Jannah Hunt in Yemen. Falcon Oil Services abandoned the contract after four days, and claimed a lack of security for delay in GES Oman returning Falcon Oil Services equipment. The arbitration award was brought against GES even though GES Oman was party to the original contract. In addition, GES believes that the arbitration should have been brought in Dubai rather than in Oman pursuant to the underlying contract. GES has been awarded a temporary stay on the enforcement of the award by the Omani courts. Mr. Hilal has a minority ownership interest in Falcon Oil Services.
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions
Our Code of Ethics will require us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, or (c) immediate family member of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.
We also require each of our directors and executive officers to annually complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.
These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.
To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our Sponsor, officers or directors unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm and the approval of a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.

Holders of NESR

Dividend Policy of NESR
We have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial Business Combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial Business Combination will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors at such time. In addition, our Board of Directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our Business Combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.
Price Range of NPS/GES Securities
Historical market price information regarding each of NPS and GES is not provided because there is no public market for either NPS or GES capital stock.
Dividend Policy of NPS
Prior to the Business Combination, NPS was a privately held company and does not have a policy of paying regular dividends to its shareholders. During the first quarter of 2018, NPS declared and paid $48.2 million in dividends to its shareholders to distribute the Receivables Proceeds, in accordance with the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement. In 2017, NPS declared approximately $20 million in dividends to its shareholders. No dividends were declared in 2015 and 2016. In future years subsequent to the Business Combination, NPS intends to establish a policy to fund a portion of the dividend that may be paid to NESRs public shareholders in line with NESRs dividend policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time there may be certain contractual restrictions on NPS ability to pay dividends. For instance, NPS has an existing syndicated loan facility, due in installments through 2025, which restricts NPS ability to pay dividends if certain covenants, which include compliance with financial ratios, are not met. Additionally, NPS also has a bridge loan facility due in August 2018 which does not permit dividend distributions until such bridge loan is fully repaid.
Dividend Policy of GES
Prior to the Business Combination, GES was a privately held company and did not have a policy of paying regular dividends to its shareholders. In 2017, GES declared approximately $90.2 million dividend to its shareholders. No dividends were declared in 2015, 2016, and the first quarter of 2018. In future years subsequent to the Business Combination GES intends to establish a policy to fund a portion of the dividend that may be paid to NESRs public shareholders in line with NESRs dividend policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time there may be certain contractual restrictions on GES ability to pay dividends. For instance, GES has a bank loan facility which includes restrictions on the distribution of dividends unless GES is in compliance with certain financial covenants required by such loan facility.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
General
We are a company formed in the British Virgin Islands as a BVI business company (company number 1935445) and our affairs are governed by our Charter, the Companies Act and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. We are authorized to issue an unlimited number of both ordinary shares of no par value and preferred shares of no par value. The following description summarizes certain terms of our shares as set out more particularly in our Charter. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.
Ordinary Shares
As of the date of this Report, there were 85,562,769 ordinary shares outstanding.
Under the Companies Act, the ordinary shares are deemed to be issued when the name of the shareholder is entered in our register of members. Our register of members is maintained by our transfer agent Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. If (a) information that is required to be entered in the register of members is omitted from the register or is inaccurately entered in the register, or (b) there is unreasonable delay in entering information in the register, a shareholder of the company, or any person who is aggrieved by the omission, inaccuracy or delay, may apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order that the register be rectified, and the court may either refuse the application or order the rectification of the register, and may direct the company to pay all costs of the application and any damages the applicant may have sustained.
At any general meeting on a show of hands every ordinary shareholder who is present in person (or, in the case of a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative) or by proxy will have one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Voting at any meeting of the ordinary shareholders is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded. A poll may be demanded by shareholders present in person or by proxy if the shareholder disputes the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution and the chairman shall cause a poll to be taken. Following the consummation of, or in connection with, our initial business combination, the rights and obligations attaching to our ordinary shares and other provisions of our Charter may be amended if approved by a majority of the votes of shareholders attending and voting on such amendment or by resolution of the directors. Our Board of Directors is divided into two classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore.
We intend that our first actual annual meeting of shareholders will be held in 2019. If our shareholders want us to hold a meeting prior to that, they may requisition the directors to hold one upon the written request of members entitled to exercise at least 30% of the voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested. Under British Virgin Islands law, we may not increase the required percentage to call a meeting above such 30% level.
Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of legally available funds. In the event of a liquidation or winding up of the company after our initial business combination, our shareholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will provide our shareholders with the redemption rights set forth above.
72
Founder Shares
The Founder Shares held by Sponsor are identical to the other ordinary shares and have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that the Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Specifically, our Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares (except to certain permitted transferees as described below) until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period 150 days after our initial business combination, the Founder Shares will be released and may be registered and sold. Pursuant to the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement and the ANI Relationship Agreement and the WAHA Relationship Agreement, additional restrictions were imposed on Sponsor to prohibit selling 50% of its ordinary shares within the first year, permitting the sale of an additional 25% after the trading price exceeds $15.00, and the final 25% after the trading price exceeds $17.50.
Preferred Shares
Our Charter authorizes the creation and issuance without shareholder approval of an unlimited number of preferred shares divided into five classes, Class A through Class E each with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined by a resolution of our Board of Directors to amend the Charter to create such designations, rights and preferences. We have five classes of preferred shares to give us flexibility as to the terms on which each Class is issued. Unlike Delaware law, all shares of a single class must be issued with the same rights and obligations. Accordingly, starting with five classes of preference shares will allow us to issue shares at different times on different terms. No preferred shares are currently issued or outstanding. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred shares with dividend, liquidation, redemption, voting or other rights, which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of ordinary shares. The preferred shares could be utilized as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Although we do not currently intend to issue any preferred shares, we may do so in the future.
The rights of preferred shareholders, once the preferred shares are in issue, may only be amended by a resolution to amend our memorandum and articles of association provided such amendment is also approved by a separate resolution of a majority of the votes of preferred shareholders who being so entitled attend and vote at the class meeting of the relevant preferred class. If our preferred shareholders want us to hold a meeting of preferred shareholders (or of a class of preferred shareholders), they may requisition the directors to hold one upon the written request of preferred shareholders entitled to exercise at least 30% of the voting rights in respect of the matter (or class) for which the meeting is requested. Under British Virgin Islands law, we may not increase the required percentage to call a meeting above 30%.
Warrants
As of the date hereof, we had 22,921,700 public warrants and 12,618,680 private warrants outstanding. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at a price of $5.75 per half share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on July 6, 2018 (30 days after the completion of our initial business combination). For example, if a warrant holder holds two warrants, such warrants will be exercisable for one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. Warrants must be exercised for whole ordinary shares. The warrants will expire on June 6, 2023 (five years after the completion of an initial business combination).
73
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no public warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in the same manner as if we called the warrants for redemption and required all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. There will be no net cash settlement of the warrants under any circumstances.
The private warrants are identical to the public warrants except that such warrants will be exercisable for cash (even if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective) or on a cashless basis, at the holders option, and will not be redeemable by us, in each case so long as they are still held by the initial purchasers or their affiliates.
We may call the warrants for redemption (excluding the private warrants), in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant,
 at any time while the warrants are exercisable,  upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder,  if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $21.00 per share, for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders, and  if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants commencing five business days prior to the 30-day trading period and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.

at any time while the warrants are exercisable,
 upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder,

upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder,
 if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $21.00 per share, for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders, and

if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $21.00 per share, for any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders, and
 if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants commencing five business days prior to the 30-day trading period and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.

if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants commencing five business days prior to the 30-day trading period and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.
The right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holders warrant upon surrender of such warrant.
The redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a substantial premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.
If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. In this case, the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Whether we will exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis will depend on a variety of factors including the price of our ordinary shares at the time the warrants are called for redemption, our cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive stock issuances.
The public warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.
74
The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend (or bonus share issue), extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of ordinary shares at a price below their respective exercise prices.
The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive ordinary shares. After the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.
Except as described above, no public warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue ordinary shares unless at the time a holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a prospectus relating to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and the ordinary shares have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants.
Warrant holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder would not be able to exercise their warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% of the ordinary shares outstanding.
Dividends
We have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our then Board of Directors. It is the present intention of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.
Our Transfer Agent, Warrant Agent, and Right Agent
The transfer agent for our ordinary shares and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.
75
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is not and has not been involved in any material legal proceedings, other than ordinary litigation incidental to its business. Although no assurances can be given about the final outcome of pending legal proceedings, at the present time the Company is not a party to any legal proceeding or investigation that, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
There are no proceedings in which any of the Companys directors, officers or any of their respective affiliates, or any beneficial shareholder of more than five percent of voting securities, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to the above-mentioned companies interest.
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
Our charter, the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, as amended and the common law of the British Virgin Islands allow us to indemnify our officers and directors from certain liabilities. Our charter provides that the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate against all direct and indirect costs, fees and expenses of any type or nature whatsoever, any person who (a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, key employee, adviser of the Company or who at the request of the Company; or (b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another enterprise.
The Company will only indemnify the individual in question if the relevant indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The decision of the Board as to whether an indemnitee acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether such indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of our charter, unless a question of law is involved.
The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the relevant indemnitee did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that such indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
The Company may purchase and maintain insurance, purchase or furnish similar protection or make other arrangements including, but not limited to, providing a trust fund, letter of credit, or surety bond in relation to any indemnitee or who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a Director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another Enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by him in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the power to indemnify him against the liability as provided in our charter.
