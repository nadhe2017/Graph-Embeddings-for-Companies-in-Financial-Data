Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company acquired Booker for $150.0 million in cash and the assumption of unvested option awards. The assumed unvested option awards were converted into options to purchase a number of shares of Class A common stock of the Company, subject to an exchange ratio as described in the Merger Agreement. At the closing of the Merger, the purchase price was adjusted based on the amount of indebtedness, cash, unpaid transaction expenses and net working capital of Booker. In addition, the Company intends to grant approximately $15.0 million in new, retention-based equity awards to certain employees of Booker who accepted post-closing employment offers with the Company.
The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through the Companys cash and cash equivalents.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 12, 2018.
