Securities Act
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made solely for the benefit of the Parties to the Purchase Agreement. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract among the Parties and as of the specific date (or dates) set forth therein and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Parties in connection with the negotiated terms. Moreover, some of those representations and warranties may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk among the Parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Purchase Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts of the Sellers, ZP&G, Enertrade or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
Subject to certain exceptions and limitations (i) ZP&G agreed to indemnify the Sellers and the Principals against any losses from breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of ZP&G and claims for brokers and finders fees incurred as a result of the Purchase Agreement and (ii) the Sellers and Principals agreed to indemnify ZP&G against any losses for breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Principals and Sellers, any liabilities for taxes and any closing date indebtedness or transaction costs. The representations and warranties generally survive the closing for 18 months, other than the representations of the Sellers with respect to due organization, authority, consent and approval, capitalization and no other representation and warranties, which survive the closing indefinitely and the representations of the Sellers with respect to employee benefit plans, taxes and anti-corruption and trade controls, which survive the closing for 30 days past the applicable statute of limitations. Except for fraud claims and tax matters indemnification is the exclusive remedy for breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants under the Purchase Agreement.
