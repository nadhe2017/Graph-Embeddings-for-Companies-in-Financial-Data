Item 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On April 16, 2018, SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (the Company) completed the merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) dated as of January 11, 2018, by and among DST Systems, Inc. (DST), the Company and Diamond Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, DST was acquired by the Company through a merger of Merger Sub with and into DST (the Merger), with DST surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Upon the consummation of the Merger, (i) each outstanding share of DST common stock (DST Stock), other than certain excluded shares, was converted into the right to receive $84.00 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration), (ii) each outstanding vested DST equity award was cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (a) (1) for each DST equity award of options to purchase shares of DST Stock (Option), the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of DST Stock represented by such Option and (2) for each other DST equity award, the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (b) the number of shares of DST Stock subject to such DST equity award, (iii) each outstanding unvested Option and outstanding unvested award of restricted stock units was converted into an equivalent equity award with respect to the Companys common stock, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted DST equity award and (iv) each outstanding unvested award of performance stock units was, according to its terms, converted into an award of time-vesting restricted stock units with respect to the Companys common stock (based on actual performance for the applicable performance period), subject to the same terms and conditions as generally applicable to the converted DST equity award.
The funds necessary to consummate the Merger were financed from approximately $6,846 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement described under Item 2.03 ($2,217 million of which were used to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company and DST), and $728 million of proceeds from the sale of 15.7 million shares of the Companys common stock on April 3, 2018 (out of an aggregate of 30.3 million shares sold in the related offering).
The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on January 11, 2018, and is incorporated herein by reference.
