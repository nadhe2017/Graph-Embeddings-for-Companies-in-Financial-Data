We believe that the issuance of the ordinary shares at the First Tranche Closing described in Item 2.01 is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) in reliance on Regulation S or pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act regarding transactions by an issuer, in each case, involving offers and sales of securities outside the United States with no directed selling efforts or not involving a public offering, respectively. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Investor represented its knowledge and financial sophistication as an investor and its intention to acquire the ordinary shares for investment only and not with a view to, or in connection with, the distribution thereof. No general advertising or solicitation has been used in offering, or will be used in selling, the ordinary shares, and the shares were offered only to Investor, a non-U.S. entity, in a transaction outside the United States.
