Item 2.01.
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Acquisition of Faster S.p.A.
On April 5, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Polyusus Lux IV S. r.l., a Luxembourg limited liability company (Polyusus Lux IV), the owner of 100% of the share capital of Faster S.p.A., an Italian joint stock company (Faster), pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement), dated February 18, 2018, among the Company, Capvis IV Co-Investors Faster L.P., a Jersey limited partnership (Capvis) and certain co-investors (collectively, with Capvis, the Sellers), which together owned all of the shares of Polyusus Lux IV.
The cash consideration paid at closing was approximately 430 million euros, less outstanding debt and unpaid transaction costs and other deductions from the purchase price set forth in the Purchase Agreement. An insurance policy was issued at closing which provides approximately $30 million of coverage to the Company for certain breaches of the representations and warranties of the Sellers in the Purchase Agreement, subject to a $2.25 million deductible.
Prior to the closing, Polyusus Lux IV owned approximately 99% of the share capital of Faster. As provided in the Purchase Agreement, concurrent with the closing, Polyusus Lux IV purchased the shares held by the minority owners of Faster, resulting in Faster becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Polyusus Lux IV.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the agreement, previously filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Companys Report on Form 8-K field on February 20, 2018, and incorporated herein by reference.
