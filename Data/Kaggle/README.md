- For our convenihttps://github.com/nadhe2017/Graph-Embeddings-for-Companies-in-Financial-Dataence, I have extracted a test set randomly to ensure that same test set is used for every model. Each test set has 2 files:  
  - *kaggle_test_text.txt* : Consists of 4768 sentences, each separated by a new line.
  - *kaggle_test_truelabels.txt* : Consists of an entity label for each word in the respective sentence in the file above.
